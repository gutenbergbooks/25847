<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>AN AFTERNOON TEA</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I wish I had a twin sister,&#8221; said Patty;
&#8220;no, that wouldn&#8217;t do, either. I wish I
were twins, and could be both of them
myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What a sensible wish!&#8221; commented Nan.
&#8220;But why do you want to double yourself up
in that way?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So I could go to two places at once. Here
I have two lovely invitations for this afternoon,
and I don&#8217;t know which I want to accept most.
One is a musicale at Mrs. Hastings&#8217;, and the
other is a picture exhibition at the New Gallery.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They sound delightful. Can&#8217;t you manage
to go to both?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, they&#8217;re too far apart; and they&#8217;re both
at four o&#8217;clock, anyway. I think I&#8217;ll choose the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
musicale, for I&#8217;ll surely get another chance to see
the pictures.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, of course you will,&#8221; agreed Nan, a
little absently, for she was reading some newly
arrived letters.
</p>
<p>The Fairfields were in London, and were
comfortably established in the Savoy Hotel. It
was April, and though they intended to travel
later in the summer, their plans were as yet
indefinite, and they were enjoying the many and
varied delights of the London season.
</p>
<p>To be sure, Nan and Mr. Fairfield were invited
to many dinners and elaborate entertainments
which Patty was too young to attend, but
her time was pleasantly filled with afternoon
garden parties or teas, while mornings were often
devoted to sight-seeing.
</p>
<p>Patty was almost eighteen, and though not
allowed quite the untrammelled freedom she
would have had in America, she was not kept
so utterly secluded as English girls of her age.
Sometimes she would go all alone to Westminster
Abbey or to the National Gallery, and enjoy
hugely a solitary hour or two. At other times,
Nan or her father, or some girl friend, would
go with her.
</p>
<p>The Fairfields had begun their stay in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
London with only a few friends, but these
had introduced others, until now their circle
of acquaintances was large, and the immediate
result of this was a sheaf of invitations
in every mail. For, during the season, Londoners
are hospitable folk, and give entertainments
morning, noon, and night. At first, the Fairfields
had thought they would take a house, and so
have a home of their own. But Mr. Fairfield
concluded that if Nan had the duties of a housekeeper,
her trip would not be a holiday, so he
declared they would live at a large hotel, and
thus have a chance to observe the gay life of
London.
</p>
<p>And so cosy and comfortable were their
apartments at the Savoy, that they soon began
to feel quite at home there. And Patty, as we
all know, was one who could adapt herself to
any mode of living.
</p>
<p>Of a naturally happy and contented disposition,
she accepted everything as it came, and enjoyed
everything with the enthusiasm so often
seen in American girls.
</p>
<p>It greatly amused her to note the differences
between herself and the English girls.
</p>
<p>To her mind, they seemed to have no enthusiasm,
no enterprise, and little capacity for enjoyment,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
while Patty enjoyed every experience
that came to her, whether a visit to Windsor
Castle, a day at Stratford, or a simple afternoon
tea in their own rooms.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I seem to have been set back two or three
years,&#8221; she said to Nan, one day. &#8220;In New
York I was almost a full-fledged young lady, but
over here, I&#8217;m treated as a little girl.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter,&#8221; said Nan, sensibly.
&#8220;You are what you are, and if the different
countries choose to treat you differently, it
doesn&#8217;t matter, does it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit. I&#8217;m Patty Fairfield, and I&#8217;m almost
eighteen, whether I&#8217;m in California or the
Fiji Islands. But it does amuse me, the way the
Londoners think we live at home. They really
believe American ladies go to market in the
morning, loaded down with diamonds. You
don&#8217;t often see that in New York, do you,
Nan?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t think I ever saw a New York
matron wearing elaborate jewelry to market.
But then I never go to market myself, and I
don&#8217;t know many people who do. I think that
bediamonded marketer story is an old tradition,
which is really pretty well worn out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the London ladies needn&#8217;t talk, anyway.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
If we did wear jewels to market, it
wouldn&#8217;t be a bit more absurd than the way they
dress to go shopping in the morning. Long,
trailing, frilly gowns of pink and blue chiffon,
with swishing lace-ruffled petticoats, that just
drag through the dirt of the streets.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now aren&#8217;t you criticising them as unfairly
as they describe us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, for what I say is true. I&#8217;ve seen them
fluttering about. And, anyway, I don&#8217;t mean
to be mean. I like them lots. I just love the
London ladies, they&#8217;re so kind to me, and invite
me to such lovely things. Of course I don&#8217;t
care if they choose to wear garden-party clothes
along Bond Street. We all have some ridiculous
ways.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Pretty Patty was fond of pretty clothes, and
the shops of Bond Street held great attractions
for her, though she herself wore a real tailor-made
costume when shopping. At first, Nan
had exercised a supervision over her purchases,
but Patty had shown such good taste, and such
quick and unerring judgment as to fabrics and
colors, that it had come about that Patty more
often advised Nan in her choosing, than the
other way.
</p>
<p>And so, many a pleasant morning was spent
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
in the beautiful London shops, buying things
they wanted, looking at things they did not
want, or noting with interest the ways and
means peculiar to English shopkeepers.
</p>
<p>Thus the days went happily by, and they had
already been more than a fortnight in London,
while as yet their plans for future travel
were unmade. Mr. and Mrs. Fairfield wanted
to go to Germany, Switzerland, and other countries,
but Patty didn&#8217;t care so much for that as
for English country, or small nearby towns.
So the matter was left unsettled, though short
and desultory discussions were held now and
then.
</p>
<p>But oftener their minds were taken up with
the doings of the moment, and they complacently
left the future to itself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then I think I&#8217;ll go to the musicale,&#8221;
said Patty. &#8220;What would you wear?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That new light blue chiffon of yours, with
the lace bolero, is just the thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and my new broad-leafed chip hat, with
the roses piled all over it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty ran away to her own room, and after a
time returned in the pretty summer costume.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do I look?&#8221; she asked, smilingly, of
Nan.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></p>
<p>Nan smiled back at the lovely vision, for
Patty&#8217;s vanity was of a mild and innocent sort,
and was rather a childish delight in dainty colors
and fabrics, than any conceit over her own
beauty.
</p>
<p>For beautiful Patty certainly was, in a sweet,
wholesome, girlish way, and not the least of her
charms was her naturalness of manner and her
entire lack of self-consciousness.
</p>
<p>She looked especially winning in the light,
filmy dress, and the big hat, weighed down with
roses.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You look all right, Patty,&#8221; answered Nan.
&#8220;That&#8217;s a duck of a frock, and suits you perfectly.
Are you going alone?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; father says I may go alone in our own
carriage to any afternoon thing. The Hartleys
will bring me home, so sha&#8216;n&#8217;t I send the carriage
back for you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I wish you would. I&#8217;m going to a tea
or two, and then we&#8217;re dining out. You&#8217;re to
dine with the Hartleys, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, if it is dinner. It&#8217;s more likely to
be schoolroom tea. Mabel Hartley is sixteen,
but I doubt if she&#8217;s allowed at dinner
yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense, of course she is. Well, then, if
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
they&#8217;re sending you home, Louise needn&#8217;t go
after you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; they&#8217;ll send somebody. Good-bye,
Nan.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye, Patty. Have a lovely time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; I always do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Away went Patty and her frills, and when she
reached Chesterton Mansions, she was soon
established under the wing of her hostess, Mrs.
Hastings.
</p>
<p>That lady was very glad to have the pretty
American girl as her guest, and she introduced
Patty to so many people that it was almost
bewildering. But after a time, the music began,
and Patty was glad to sit still and listen.
</p>
<p>It was very fine music, for that is the sort that
Londoners usually offer at their teas, and Patty
thoroughly enjoyed the singing and the violin-playing.
She was a little afraid that Mrs. Hastings
would ask her to sing, but as it was a
programme of professionals this did not happen.
</p>
<p>When the Hartleys came, Mabel at once made
her way to Patty&#8217;s side and sat down by her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad to see you again,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and
it&#8217;s so lovely that you&#8217;re going home with us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad, too,&#8221; returned Patty, &#8220;it was lovely
of you to ask me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></p>
<p>Mabel Hartley was an English girl, and was
about as different from Patty as could well be
imagined, and perhaps for this reason the two
were very good friends. Although they had
met only a few times, they liked each other from
the beginning, and both were ready to continue
the friendship.
</p>
<p>Mabel was large and stout, with the solidity
which characterises the British young girls. She
was large-boned and not very graceful, but she
carried herself with a patrician air that told of
past generations of good-breeding. Her complexion
was of that pure pink and white seen
only on English faces, but her pale, sandy hair
and light blue eyes failed to add the deeper
color that was needed. Her frock was an uninteresting
shade of tan, and did not hang evenly,
while her hat was one of those tubby affairs
little short of ridiculous.
</p>
<p>Patty fairly ached to re-clothe her, in some
pretty clear color, and a becoming hat.
</p>
<p>The girls were politely silent while the music
was going on, but in the intervals between the
numbers they chattered glibly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Grace Meredith and her brother Tom
just coming in,&#8221; said Mabel. &#8220;I hope they&#8217;ll
come over here; you&#8217;ll like them, I know.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></p>
<p>The Merediths did come over, and were
promptly introduced to Patty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; said Tom Meredith, as he
shook hands in cordial, boyish fashion, &#8220;you&#8217;re
the first American girl I&#8217;ve ever met.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I, really?&#8221; laughed Patty. &#8220;Now don&#8217;t
ask me if we always wear our diamonds to
market, for truly the American women who go
to market rarely have any diamonds.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never believed that diamond story, anyway,&#8221;
responded Tom, gravely, &#8220;but I&#8217;m glad
to have you tell me it isn&#8217;t true. I&#8217;m perfectly
unprejudiced about America, though. I&#8217;m ready
to believe it&#8217;s the best country in the world, outside
of our own little island.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good for you!&#8221; cried Patty. &#8220;Then I&#8217;m
ready to acknowledge that I like England next
best to America.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you been here long?&#8221; asked Grace.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, only about two weeks, but I love London
better every day, and I know I shall love the
English country. Just the glimpse I caught coming
in the train from Dover was delightful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You should see the Hartleys&#8217; country place,&#8221;
declared Tom, with enthusiasm. &#8220;It&#8217;s a ripping
old house, two hundred years old, and all
that. And such parks and orchards! Well!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you will come to see it, Patty,&#8221; said
Mabel, a little wistfully, and Patty wondered
why the girl&#8217;s tone had in it a note of sadness.
</p>
<p>But just then, as the music was over, Mrs.
Hastings asked them to go to the tea-room, and
the group of young people followed in her
wake.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You girls sit here,&#8221; said Tom, selecting a
jolly-looking alcove, with window-seats and red
cushions, &#8220;while I stalk some food.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was back in a few moments, followed by a
waiter, who brought a tray of teacups and
plates of sweet cakes.
</p>
<p>Tom, himself, bore triumphantly a covered silver
dish.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Muffins!&#8221; he announced, in a jubilant voice.
&#8220;Hot, buttered muffins! Crickets, what
luck!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The hot muffins, buttered and quartered, were
indeed delicious, and England and America
seemed at one in showing an appreciative appetite
for them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have these in America,&#8221; said Patty,
surveying her bit of muffin with admiration.
&#8220;We have good sandwiches, though.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We almost never have sandwiches,&#8221; said
Grace.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to,&#8221; said Patty, quickly.
&#8220;Your wonderful bread and butter is too good
to be spoiled with a sandwich filling of any
sort.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Most all things are good eating at an afternoon
tea,&#8221; observed Tom. &#8220;Somehow, at five
o&#8217;clock I&#8217;m always so hungry I could eat a brickbat
if it were toasted and buttered.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Afternoon tea is really an acquired taste with
us,&#8221; said Patty. &#8220;You seem to have it naturally,
even when you&#8217;re alone, but we only have
it when we have guests.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221; said Mabel, in astonishment.
&#8220;Why, we&#8217;d as soon think of omitting breakfast
or dinner as tea.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lovely meal,&#8221; said Patty, giving a little
sigh of satisfaction, as her last crumb of muffin
disappeared. &#8220;Such good things to eat, and
then it&#8217;s so cosy and informal to sit around in
easy chairs, instead of at a big table.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the ideal place for tea is on the lawn,&#8221;
said Tom. &#8220;The open air and the trees and
birds and flowers are even a better setting for
it, than an interior like this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope I shall have that kind this summer,&#8221;
said Patty. &#8220;I&#8217;m invited to several country
houses, and I know I shall enjoy it immensely.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed you will,&#8221; said Mabel, and again
Patty thought she detected a shade of sadness
in her friend&#8217;s eyes.
</p>
<p>But if Mabel was not exactly gay, Grace Meredith
made up for it. She was full of fun and
laughter, and both she and Tom made comical
speeches until Patty feared she would disgrace
herself laughing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the joke?&#8221; asked Mrs. Hartley,
coming to collect her young people and take
them home.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom is making verses about the people here,&#8221;
explained Grace. &#8220;Tell Mrs. Hartley the one
about the violinist, Tom.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s rude, Mrs. Hartley,&#8221; said
young Meredith; &#8220;truly, it isn&#8217;t meant to be.
But for that classic-browed genius, with his
chrysanthemum of tawny-colored hair, isn&#8217;t this
a pleasant token of regard and esteem?
</p>

</td></tr></table>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very beautiful,&#8221; said Mrs. Hartley, smiling,
&#8220;and I daresay Professor Prendergast
would enjoy it himself, were he to hear it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He might,&#8221; said Tom, doubtfully, &#8220;but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
musicians rarely have a sense of humour, at least,
about themselves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; agreed Mrs. Hartley, &#8220;and
now, Mabel and Miss Fairfield, we must be going
on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Good-byes were soon said, and in the Hartleys&#8217;
carriage Patty was taken away to her first
visit in an English home.

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>RIDDLES AND GAMES</h3>
</div>

<p>Much to Patty&#8217;s satisfaction Mabel
Hartley was in the habit of dining with
her elders and was not condemned to
&#8220;schoolroom tea.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The family was not large, consisting only of
Mrs. Hartley, her mother, Mrs. Cromarty, her
two sons, and Mabel. The sons, Sinclair and
Robert, were big, stalwart fellows, a few years
older than Mabel.
</p>
<p>Patty liked them at once, for they were cordial
and hearty in their greetings, and quite at ease in
their conversation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, Mater,&#8221; began Bob, after they were
seated at dinner, &#8220;there&#8217;s a stunning garden-party
on at Regent&#8217;s Park next week. Don&#8217;t
you think we can all go? Tickets only two
shillings each.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, my son? A charity affair?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Rest cure for semi-orphans, or something.
But they&#8217;ve all sorts of jolly shows, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
the Stagefright Club is going to give a little
original play. Oh, say we go!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see about it,&#8221; answered Mrs. Hartley.
&#8220;Perhaps, if we make up a party, Miss Fairfield
will go with us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d love to,&#8221; said Patty. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen a
real English garden party.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, this isn&#8217;t a real English garden party in
the true sense,&#8221; said Sinclair. &#8220;To see that, you
must be in the country. But this is a public
London garden party and typical of its sort.
You&#8217;ll like it, I&#8217;m sure. Will you go with us,
Grandy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>At first it seemed incongruous to Patty to hear
the dignified Mrs. Cromarty addressed by such
a nickname, but as she came to know her better,
the name seemed really appropriate. The lady
was of the class known as <i>grande dame</i>, and her
white hair and delicate, sharply-cut features betokened
a high type of English aristocracy. Her
voice was very sweet and gentle, and she smiled
at her big grandson, as she replied:
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, my boy; I lost my taste for garden
parties some years ago. But it&#8217;s a fine setting for
you young people, and I hope Emmeline will
take you all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother said she&#8217;d see about it,&#8221; said Mabel,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
&#8220;and that&#8217;s always the same as &#8216;yes.&#8217; If it&#8217;s
going to be &#8216;no,&#8217; she says, &#8216;I&#8217;ll think it over.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a great thing to understand your mother-tongue
so well,&#8221; said Patty, laughing; &#8220;now I
shouldn&#8217;t have known those distinctions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a wonderful talent for languages,&#8221;
said Sinclair, gravely. &#8220;Indeed, we have a
language of our own. Shall I teach it to
you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You might try,&#8221; said Patty, &#8220;but I&#8217;m not at
all clever as a linguist.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You may not learn it easily, but it can be
taught in one sentence. It consists in merely
using the initial of the word instead of the
word itself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But so many words begin with the same
initial,&#8221; said Patty, bewildered at the idea.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but it&#8217;s ever so much easier than you&#8217;d
think. Now listen. Wouldn&#8217;t you understand
me if I said: &#8216;D y w t g t t g p?&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say it again, please, and say it slowly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sinclair repeated the letters, and Patty clapped
her hands, crying: &#8220;Yes, yes, of course I understand.
You mean &#8216;Do you want to go to
the garden party?&#8217; Now, listen to me while I
answer: Y I w t g i i d r.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; exclaimed Mabel. &#8220;You said:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
&#8216;Yes, I want to go, if it doesn&#8217;t rain.&#8217; Oh, you
are a quick pupil.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But those are such easy sentences,&#8221; said
Patty, as she considered the matter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the point,&#8221; said Bob, &#8220;most sentences,
at least, the ones we use most, <i>are</i> easy. If I
should meet you unexpectedly, and say H d y d?
you&#8217;d know I meant How do you do? Or if I
took leave, and said G b, you&#8217;d understand
good-bye. Those are the simplest possible examples.
Now, on the other hand, if I were to
read you a long speech from the morning paper,
you&#8217;d probably miss many of the long words, but
that&#8217;s the other extreme. We&#8217;ve talked in
initials for years, and rarely are we uncertain
as to the sense, though we may sometimes skip
a word here and there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what good is it?&#8221; asked Patty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No good at all,&#8221; admitted Bob; &#8220;but it&#8217;s fun.
And after you&#8217;re used to it, you can talk that
way so fast that any one listening couldn&#8217;t guess
what you are saying. Sometimes when we&#8217;re
riding on an omnibus, or anything like that, it&#8217;s
fun to talk initials and mystify the people.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;D y o d t?&#8221; said Patty, her eyes twinkling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we often do that,&#8221; returned Bob, greatly
gratified at the rapid progress of the new pupil.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
&#8220;You must be fond of puzzles, to catch this up
so quickly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; said Patty. &#8220;I&#8217;ve guessed puzzles
ever since I was a little girl. I always solve
all I can find in the papers, and sometimes I take
prizes for them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We do that too,&#8221; said Mabel; &#8220;and sometimes
we make puzzles and send them to the
papers and they print them. Let&#8217;s make some
for each other this evening.&#8221;
</p>
<p>After dinner the young people gathered round
the table in the pleasant library, and were soon
busy with paper and pencils. Patty found the
Hartleys a match for her in quickness and ingenuity,
but she was able to guess as great a
proportion of their puzzles as they of hers.
</p>
<p>After amusing themselves with square words
and double acrostics, they drifted to conundrums,
and Bob asked:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Which letter of the Dutch alphabet spells an
English lady of rank?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not fair,&#8221; objected Patty, &#8220;because I
don&#8217;t know the Dutch alphabet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t matter,&#8221; said Mabel, &#8220;you can
guess it just as well without.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed I can&#8217;t, and besides I don&#8217;t know the
names of all the English ladies of rank.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t matter either,&#8221; said Sinclair,
smiling; &#8220;it spells a title, not a name; and one
you know very well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t guess it, anyway,&#8221; said Patty, after a
few moment&#8217;s thought. &#8220;I give it up; tell
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Dutch S,&#8221; said Bob, and Patty agreed
that it was a good catch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, I&#8217;ll catch you,&#8221; said Patty. &#8220;You all
know your London pretty well, I suppose, and
are familiar with the places of interest. Well,
Mabel, why is your nose like St. Paul&#8217;s?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mabel thought hard, and so did the boys.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is my nose like St. Paul&#8217;s, too?&#8221; asked
Bob, thoughtfully, stroking his well-shaped
feature.
</p>
<p>Patty looked at it critically. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;and so is Sinclair&#8217;s. But why?&#8221;
</p>
<p>At last they gave it up, and Patty said, triumphantly,
&#8220;Because it is made of flesh and
blood.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They all screamed with laughter, for they
quickly saw the point, and realised that it was
the historic character referred to, and not the
cathedral.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s one,&#8221; said Sinclair: &#8220;Where did the
Prince of Wales go on his eleventh birthday?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
But Patty was quite quick enough for this.
&#8220;Into his twelfth year,&#8221; she answered promptly.
&#8220;And now listen to this: A man walking out
at night, met a beggar asking alms. The man
gave him ten cents. He met another beggar
and gave him fifteen cents. What time
was it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Time for him to go home,&#8221; declared
Bob, but Patty said that was not the right
answer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Springtime,&#8221; guessed Mabel, &#8220;because the
man was in such a good humor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Patty, &#8220;it was quarter to two.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her hearers looked utterly blank at this, and,
suddenly realising that they were not very familiar
with American coins, Patty explained the
joke. They saw it, of course, but seemed to
think it not very good, and Sinclair whimsically
insisted on calling it, &#8220;a shilling to Bob,&#8221; which
he said was equally nonsensical.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Give us one of your poetry ones, Grandy,&#8221;
said Bob to Mrs. Cromarty, who sat by, quietly
enjoying the young people&#8217;s fun.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Fairfield may not care for the old-fashioned
enigma, but I will offer this one,&#8221;
and in her fine, clear voice the old lady recited
her verse with elocutionary effect:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;Afloat upon the ocean</p>

<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>Can you tell me, children? What?&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>The others had heard this before, and when
Patty promptly guessed &#8220;Bark,&#8221; Mrs. Cromarty
was distinctly pleased with her quick-wittedness.
</p>
<p>Then lemonade and wafery little cakes were
brought in, that the puzzlers might refresh
themselves.
</p>
<p>The atmosphere of the Hartley household was
very pleasant, and Patty felt much more at
home than she had ever expected to feel among
English people. She made allusion to this, and
Bob said: &#8220;Oh, this place isn&#8217;t homey at all,
compared with our real home. You must come
to see us down in the country, mustn&#8217;t she,
mother?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should be very glad to welcome you there,
my dear,&#8221; said Mrs. Hartley, smiling at Patty,
&#8220;and I trust it may be arranged. We have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
this apartment for only a few weeks longer,
and then we shall go back to Leicester.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in no haste to go,&#8221; declared Mabel. &#8220;I
love Cromarty Manor, but I want to stay in
London a little longer. But when we do go,
Patty, you surely must visit us there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed I will, if I can manage it. My parents
want me to go with them to Switzerland,
but I&#8217;d much prefer to spend the summer in
England. I have ever so many delightful invitations
to country houses, and they seem to me
a lot more attractive than travelling about. I
suppose I ought to care more about seeing
places, but I don&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re quite young enough yet,&#8221; said Mrs.
Hartley, &#8220;to look forward to travelling in future
years. I think some experiences of English
life would be quite as advantageous for
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell father you said that,&#8221; said Patty.
&#8220;Then perhaps he&#8217;ll let me have my own way.
But he usually does that, anyway.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d love Cromarty Manor,&#8221; said Bob, enthusiastically.
&#8220;It&#8217;s so beautiful in spring and
early summer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But not half as grand as other houses where
Patty&#8217;s invited,&#8221; said Mabel, and again the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
shadow crossed her face that seemed always to
come when she spoke of her country home.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Grandeur doesn&#8217;t count in the country,&#8221; declared
Bob. &#8220;That belongs to London life.
Other places may be larger or in better
condition than ours, but they <i>can&#8217;t</i> be more
beautiful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is true,&#8221; said Mrs. Cromarty, in her
quiet way, which always seemed to decide a disputed
point. And then it was time to go home,
and Mrs. Hartley sent Patty away in her carriage,
with a maid to accompany her. The
woman was middle-aged, with a pleasant voice
and a capable manner. She chatted affably with
Patty, and dilated a little on the glories of the
Cromarty family.
</p>
<p>Patty realised at once that she was an old
family servant, and had earned a right to a
little more freedom of speech than is usual to
English domestics.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, Miss,&#8221; she said; &#8220;it&#8217;s a wonnerful
old place, that it is. And if the dear lady
only &#8217;ad the money as is &#8217;ers by right, she&#8217;d
keep it up lordly, that she would.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty wondered what had become of the money
in question, but Sarah said no more concerning
it, and Patty felt she had no right to ask.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
&#8220;You live with them, then, in the country?&#8221;
she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Miss, I&#8217;ve allus lived with them. My
mother was housekeeper at the Manor when Miss
Emmeline married Mr. &#8217;Artley. Oh, he was the
fine gentleman. Dead now, this ten year come
Whitsuntide. Master Bob, he&#8217;s the image of
his father. Are you warm enough, Miss?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sarah&#8217;s quick transit from reminiscences to solicitude
for her comfort almost startled Patty,
but she was getting used to that peculiarity of
the British mind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, thank you,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and anyway,
we&#8217;re home now. Here&#8217;s the Savoy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Fairfield and Nan had not yet arrived,
so the good Sarah attended Patty to her own
apartment and gave her over to Louise, who
awaited her coming.
</p>
<p>Louise helped her off with her pretty frock, and
brought her a beribboned négligée, and Patty
curled up in a big armchair in front of the
fire to think over the evening.
</p>
<p>&#8220;These wood-fires are lovely,&#8221; she said to
herself, &#8220;and they do have most comfortable
stuffed chairs over here, if they only knew
enough to put rockers under them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty was a comfort-loving creature, and often
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
bewailed the absence of the rocking-chairs so
dear to her American heart. Soon her parents
came in and found her sound asleep in the big
chair.
</p>
<p>She woke up, as her father kissed her lightly
on the forehead.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Prince Charming,&#8221; she said, smiling
gaily at the handsome man in evening clothes
who stood looking down at her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you want a return compliment
about the Sleeping Beauty,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but you
won&#8217;t get it. Too much flattery isn&#8217;t good for
a baby like you, and I shall reserve my pretty
speeches for my wife.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll share them with Patty,&#8221; laughed
Nan, &#8220;but with no one else.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell us about your evening, girlie,&#8221; said her
father. &#8220;Did you have a good time?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine,&#8221; said Patty. &#8220;The Hartleys are
lovely people; I like them better than any I&#8217;ve
met in London, so far. And they do puzzles,
and ask riddles, and they&#8217;re just as clever and
quick as Americans. I&#8217;ve heard that English
people were heavy and stupid, and they&#8217;re not,
a bit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t believe all you hear. Are they
a large family?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
&#8220;Not very. Two sons, one daughter, and the
mother and grandmother. Mabel&#8217;s father has
been dead for years. And they want me to visit
them at their home in Leicester this summer.
Can&#8217;t I go?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Desert your own family for foreigners!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I do want to go there and to some other
country places while you and Nan go touristing
about. Mayn&#8217;t I?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t decide now. It&#8217;s too near midnight
for important matters to be discussed.
Skip to bed, chickabiddy, and dream of the Stars
and Stripes, lest you forget them entirely.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never!&#8221; cried Patty, striking a dramatic attitude.

<p>And humming the Star-spangled Banner, she
went away to her own room.

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>THE WHITE LADY</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I feel in a gay mood,&#8221; said Nan, as she
clasped Patty round the waist, and always
ready for a dance, Patty fell into
step, and the two waltzed round the room, while
Patty sang tum-te-tum to the air of a popular
song.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As if you two ever felt any other way!&#8221; exclaimed
Mr. Fairfield, smiling at them from the
depths of his easy chair. &#8220;But what does this
gay mood betoken? I suppose you want to drag
me out to the theatre or opera to-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Fairfield&#8217;s pleasant smile belied his pretense
at sharpness, and he waited to hear a
reply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be lovely,&#8221; said Nan, &#8220;and we&#8217;ll
go if you invite us. But what I had in mind is
this: I&#8217;d like to dine in the Restaurant.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; cried Mr. Fairfield. &#8220;I feel gay
enough for that, myself, and we haven&#8217;t dined
there for nearly a week.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Fairfields had a complete apartment of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
their own, and when not invited out, usually
dined quietly in their own dining-room. But
occasionally, when the mood took them, they
dined in the great Savoy Restaurant, which was
a festive pageant indeed.
</p>
<p>Patty loved to sit at a table there, and watch
the beautiful women in their elaborate gowns,
and their handsome, stalwart escorts, who were
sometimes in brave uniforms.
</p>
<p>The splendid scene would have palled upon
them, had they dined there every evening, but as
a change from their small family dinner it was
delightful.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll wear our dress-up frocks,&#8221; said Patty,
&#8220;and perhaps my White Lady will be there
again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your White Lady?&#8221; asked Nan. &#8220;Who is
she?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what I can&#8217;t find out, though I&#8217;ve
asked several people. But she&#8217;s the most beautiful
lady, with a haughty, proud face, and sad
eyes. She always wears white, and there&#8217;s an
elderly lady who is sometimes with her. A
strange-looking old lady in black, she is; and her
face is like a hawk&#8217;s.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I remember those people; they always
sit at the same table.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
&#8220;Yes, I think they live here. But she is so
sweet and lovely I&#8217;d like to know her. I
make up stories about her all to myself. She&#8217;s
like Ginevra or the Lady of Shalott.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re too fanciful, Patty. Probably she&#8217;s
the Duchess of Hardscrabble.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She looks like a Duchess, anyway. And also,
she looks like a simple, sweet, lovely lady. I&#8217;m
going to ask father to find out who she is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A little later the Fairfields went down to dinner.
</p>
<p>Nan wore an exquisite gown of embroidered
yellow satin, and Patty wore a frilled white silk
muslin. It was a little low at the throat, and
was very becoming to her, and in and out of
her piled-up curls was twisted a broad white
ribbon, which ended in front in a saucy cluster
of bows, after the prevailing fashion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is great fun,&#8221; said Patty, as she took
her seat with a little sigh of content. &#8220;I just
love the lights and flowers and music and
noise&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you distinguish the music from the
noise?&#8221; asked her father, laughing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can if I try, but I don&#8217;t care whether I
do or not. I love the whole conglomeration of
sounds. People laughing and talking, and a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
sort of undertone of glass and china and
waiters.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds graphic,&#8221; said Nan, &#8220;but the
waiters here aren&#8217;t supposed to make any noise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I know it, but they&#8217;re just part of the
whole scene, and it&#8217;s all beautiful together. Oh,
there&#8217;s my White Lady!&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was indeed a charming young woman who
was just entering the room. She was tall and
very slender, with a face serene and sweet. Her
large, dark eyes had a look of resignation,
rather than sadness, but the firm set of her
scarlet lips did not betoken an easily-resigned
nature.
</p>
<p>With her was the elder lady of whom Patty
had spoken. She was sharp-featured and looked
as if she were sharp-tempered. She wore a
rather severe evening gown of black net, and in
her gray hair was a quivering black aigrette.
</p>
<p>In contrast to this dark figure, the younger lady
looked specially fair and sweet. Her trailing
gown was of heavy white lace, and round her
beautiful throat were two long strings of pearls.
She wore no other ornament save for a white
flower in her hair, and her shoulders and arms
were almost as white as the soft tulle that billowed
against them.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></p>
<p>It chanced that Mr. Fairfield&#8217;s table was quite
near the one usually occupied by these two, and
Patty watched the White Lady, without seeming
to stare at her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t she exquisite?&#8221; she said, at last, for
they were not within earshot, and Nan agreed
that she was.
</p>
<p>As the dinner proceeded, Patty glanced often at
the lady of her admiration, and after a time was
surprised and a little embarrassed to find that
the White Lady was glancing at her.
</p>
<p>Fearing she had stared more frankly than she
realised, Patty refrained from looking at the
lady again, and resolutely kept her eyes turned
in other directions.
</p>
<p>But as if drawn by a magnet, she felt impelled
to look at her once more, and giving a quick
glance, she saw the White Lady distinctly smiling
at her. There was no mistake, it was a
kind, amused little smile of a most friendly nature.
</p>
<p>Patty was enchanted, and the warm blood
rushed to her cheeks as if she had been singled
out for a great honour. But frankly, and without
embarrassment, she smiled back at the lovely
face, and returned the pleased little nod that
was then given her.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Patty, what <i>are</i> you doing?&#8221; said Nan; &#8220;do
you see any one you know?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Patty, slowly, almost as one in a
dream, &#8220;my White Lady smiled at me,&mdash;that&#8217;s
all,&mdash;so I smiled back at her, and then we
bowed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t do such things,&#8221; said Nan, half
smiling herself, &#8220;she&#8217;ll think you&#8217;re a forward
American.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am an American,&#8221; replied Patty, &#8220;and
I&#8217;d be sorry to be called backward.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You never will be,&#8221; said her father. &#8220;Well,
I suppose you may smile at her, if she smiles
first, but don&#8217;t begin sending her anonymous
notes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; said Patty, &#8220;but you two don&#8217;t
know how lovely she is when she smiles.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Fairfield were seated with their
backs to the lady in question, and could not see
her without slightly turning their heads, while
Patty, opposite them at the round table, faced
her directly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re fortunate in your position,&#8221; observed
her father, &#8220;for were you seated here and we
there, of course she would have beamed upon
us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She isn&#8217;t beaming,&#8221; cried Patty, almost indignantly;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
&#8220;I won&#8217;t have that angelic smile
called a beam. Now, you&#8217;re not to tease. She&#8217;s
a sweet, dear lady, with some awful tragedy
gnawing at her heart.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty, you&#8217;re growing up romantic! Stop
it at once. I&#8217;ll buy the lady for you, if you
want her, but I won&#8217;t have you indulging in
rubbishy romance like that, with nothing to base
it on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty looked at her father comically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe you&#8217;d better buy her, Daddy,
dear,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You know you often say that,
with Nan and me on your hands, you have all
you can manage. So I&#8217;m sure you couldn&#8217;t add
those two to your collection; for I feel certain
wherever the White Lady goes the Black Lady
goes too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The subject was lost sight of then, by the
greetings of some friends who were passing by
the Fairfields on their way out of the Restaurant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Mrs. Leigh,&#8221; exclaimed Nan, &#8220;how
do you do? Won&#8217;t you and Mr. Leigh sit
down and have coffee with us? Or, better yet,
suppose we all go up to our drawing-room and
have coffee there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>After Patty had spoken to the newcomers and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
was sitting silent while her elders were talking,
she looked up in surprise as a waiter approached
her. He laid a long-stemmed white rose beside
her plate, and said, quietly, &#8220;From Lady
Hamilton, Miss.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Involuntarily, Patty glanced at the White
Lady, and seeing her smile, knew at once that
she had sent the rose.
</p>
<p>As Patty explained the presence of the flower to
the others, Mrs. Leigh glanced across, and
said: &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s Lady Hamilton! Excuse me,
I must speak to her just a moment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is Lady Hamilton?&#8221; asked Nan of
Mr. Leigh, unable longer to repress her interest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the best and most beautiful women
in London,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;One of the most indifferent,
and the most sought after; one of the
richest, and the saddest; one of the most popular,
and the loneliest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>All this seemed enough to verify Patty&#8217;s surmises
of romance connected with the White
Lady, but before she could ask a question, Mrs.
Leigh returned, and Lady Hamilton came with
her. After introductions and a few words of
greeting, Lady Hamilton said to Mr. Fairfield:
&#8220;I wonder if you couldn&#8217;t be induced to lend
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
me your daughter for an hour or so. I will do
my best to entertain her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, yes, Lady Hamilton; and I think you
will find her quite ready to be borrowed. You
seemed to cast a magic spell over her, even before
she knew your name.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must confess that I have been wanting to
meet her; I have searched this room in vain
for some mutual friend who might introduce us,
but until I saw Mrs. Leigh over here, I could
find no one. Then, to attract Mrs. Leigh&#8217;s attention,
in hope of her helping me, I sent over
a signal of distress.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I took it as a flag of truce,&#8221; said Patty, holding
up the white rose as it trembled on its stem.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought it was a cipher message,&#8221; said
Nan, smiling. &#8220;Patty is so fond of puzzles and
secret languages, I wasn&#8217;t sure but it might mean
&#8216;All is discovered; fly at once!&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It means &#8216;all is well&#8217;,&#8221; said Lady Hamilton,
in her gracious way; &#8220;and now I must fly at
once with my spoil.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She took possession of Patty, and with a few
words of adieu to the others, led her from the
room. The lady in black rose from the table
and followed them, and Patty entered the lift,
blissfully happy, but a little bewildered.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have our coffee right here,&#8221; said Lady
Hamilton, as having reached her drawing-room,
she proceeded to adjust some dainty gilt cups
that stood on a small table. &#8220;That is,
if you are allowed to have coffee at night.
From your roseleaf cheeks, I fancy you drink
only honeydew or buttercup tea.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed; I&#8217;m far too substantial for those
things,&#8221; said Patty, as she dropped into the
cosy chair Lady Hamilton had indicated; &#8220;and
for over a year now, I&#8217;ve been allowed to have
after-dinner coffee.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me! what a grown-up! Miss Fairfield,
this is Mrs. Betham, my very good friend, who
looks after me when I get frisky and try to
scrape acquaintance across a public dining-room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>If Lady Hamilton was lovely when she was
silent, she was doubly bewitching when she
talked in this gay strain. Little dimples came
and went in her cheeks, so quickly that they had
scarcely disappeared before they were back
again.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Betham bowed and spoke politely to
Patty, but her voice was quick and sharp,
and her manner, though courteous, was not
attractive.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I doubt the coffee&#8217;s hot,&#8221; she said, as a
waiter, who had just brought it in, was filling
the tiny cups.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s steaming,&#8221; said Lady Hamilton, gaily,
and Patty saw at once that whatever it was that
made her new friend sorrowful, it was not the
grumbling tones of Mrs. Betham.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s quite too hot, Julia,&#8221; she went on; &#8220;unless
you&#8217;re careful, you&#8217;ll steam your throat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not I,&#8221; growled Mrs. Betham. &#8220;I&#8217;m not
such a stupid as that. But I must say I like
my coffee at a table like a Christian, and not
setting my cup in my lap, or holding it up in the
air.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me, Julia,&#8221; said Lady Hamilton, with
great solicitude expressed on her face; &#8220;dear me,
your gout must be very bad to-night. It makes
you quite cross. Poor dear!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Betham sniffed at this, but a grim smile
came into her eyes, and Patty concluded she was
not quite so grumpy as she seemed.
</p>
<p>After the coffee was finished, and the tray taken
away, Mrs. Betham excused herself and went
off to her own room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The way it began,&#8221; said Lady Hamilton, as
if to explain her interest in Patty, &#8220;was one
day when I went through the corridors and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
passed your drawing-room, and the door was a
little mite ajar, and I heard you singing. I am
very fond of just that high, sweet kind of voice
that you have, and I paused a few moments to
listen to you. Then afterward I saw you in the
dining-room two or three times at luncheon or
dinner, and I took a fancy to know you, for I
felt sure I should like you. Do you mind coming
to see me once in a while, my dear? I am
very lonely.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mind! No, indeed!&#8221; cried Patty, impetuously
throwing her arms around her new friend.
&#8220;I loved you the first time I ever saw you. But
why do you say you are lonely? You, a great
lady.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will tell you my story in a few words,&#8221; said
Lady Hamilton. &#8220;For I suppose you would
hear it from others, and I would rather tell it
you myself. I am the daughter of Sir Otho
Markleham. Of course, if you were a Londoner,
you would know all this, but as you&#8217;re
not, I&#8217;ll tell you. Well, I am Sir Otho&#8217;s only
daughter, and four years ago, when I was just
eighteen, I ran away from home and married
Lord Cecil Hamilton. He was a good man,
but he had quarrelled with my father on
a point of politics, and my father disapproved
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
of the match. He disowned me as
his daughter, though he said he would always
continue the allowance I had had as a girl. I
was glad of this, not only because Lord Hamilton,
though a man of good fortune, was not a
wealthy man, but also because it seemed to
show my father had not entirely cast me off.
But he forbade us to go to his house, and we
went to Paris and lived there for a year. After
one year of happy married life Cecil died, and
since then my only aim in life has been to be
reconciled to my father. But he will not have
it, or at least he won&#8217;t have it unless I make
the first overtures toward peace.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And won&#8217;t you?&#8221; cried Patty, in astonishment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not I! I am not to blame. The two men
quarrelled, and now that Cecil is gone, why
should my father hold the feud against me?
It is not my place to ask his pardon; I&#8217;ve done
nothing wrong.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You ran away from home,&#8221; said Patty, thinking
only of the justice of the case, and quite forgetting
that she was seeming to censure a titled
English lady.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but that was not wrong. Father knew
that Cecil was a fine, honourable man, of an
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
old family. He had no right to forbid my
marriage because of a foolish personal disagreement.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your mother?&#8221; said Patty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My mother died when I was a child,&#8221; said
Lady Hamilton, and at once Patty felt a new
bond of companionship.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I lived alone with my father, in our great
house in London, and I had a happy and uneventful
life, until Cecil came. Since his death,
I&#8217;ve longed so to go home to my father, and
be at peace with him, but though many kind
friends have tried to bring about a reconciliation,
they haven&#8217;t been able to do so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And so you live here alone at the Savoy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, with Mrs. Betham, who is really an
old dear, though sometimes she grumbles
terribly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And do you go into society?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve begun to go a little, of late. Cecil made
me promise I&#8217;d never wear black dresses, so I&#8217;ve
worn white only, ever since he died, and I suppose
I always shall. That is, in the house. I
have black street gowns. But I can&#8217;t seem to
care for gay parties as I used to. I want father,
and I want my home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is your father in London?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; he&#8217;s a Member of Parliament. But
he&#8217;s of a stubborn and unyielding nature.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And so are you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And so am I. Now, let&#8217;s drop the subject of
myself for the present, while you sing for me.
Will you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed,&#8221; said Patty, warmly; &#8220;with
more pleasure than I ever sang for any one else.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>A FLORAL OFFERING</h3>
</div>

<p>As the days went by, Patty and Lady
Hamilton became close friends. Mr. and
Mrs. Fairfield approved of the intimacy,
for the elder woman&#8217;s influence was in every
way good for Patty, and in return the girl
brought sunshine and happiness into Lady
Hamilton&#8217;s life.
</p>
<p>They went together to concerts and picture exhibitions,
but Patty could rarely persuade her
friend to go to a social affair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s absurd, Lady Hamilton,&#8221; said Patty, one
day, &#8220;to shut yourself up as you do! All London
wants you, and yet you won&#8217;t go &#8217;round and
play pretty with them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ignoring this outburst, Lady Hamilton only
smiled, and said: &#8220;Do you know, Patty, I
think it&#8217;s time you dropped my formal title, and
called me by my first name. I&#8217;d love to have
you do so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve often wondered what your first name is,
but I haven&#8217;t the slightest idea. Tell me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, guess. What name do you think suits
me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty considered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, at last, &#8220;I think it must be
either Ethelfrida or Gwendolyn Gladys.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lady Hamilton laughed merrily. &#8220;Prepare
yourself for a sudden shock,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I was
named for my grandmother, Catharine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Catharine! What an absurd name for you!
You&#8217;re not even a Kate. But you are Lady
Kitty, and I&#8217;ll call you that, if I may.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed you may. Father used to call me
Kitty, when I was a child, but as I grew older,
I preferred my full name.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lady Kitty is just right for you, and when
you&#8217;re in the mood you&#8217;re a saucy puss. Now,
listen, the reason for my invasion of your premises
this morning is that I want you to go with
me this afternoon to a tea on the Terrace of
Parliament House.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty&#8217;s tones were very persuasive, and she
looked so daintily attractive in her fresh morning
gown that few could have refused any request
she might make.
</p>
<p>Lady Hamilton in a soft, frilly white négligée,
was sipping her coffee and looking over her
letters when Patty had interrupted the process.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
She looked at her eager young guest with a slow,
provoking smile, and said only:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nixy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But why not?&#8221; said Patty, smiling too, for
she knew the Englishwoman had learned the
slangy word from herself. &#8220;You&#8217;d have a
lovely time. It&#8217;s so beautiful there, and the people
are always so cordial and pleasant.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t want to go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you <i>ought</i> to want to. You&#8217;re too young
to give up the pomps and vanities of this world.
How can I <i>make</i> you go?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it! That&#8217;s just the trouble with you.
I never saw such a stubborn, self-willed, determined&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pigheaded?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes! and stupidly obstinate thing as you are!
So, there now!&#8221;
</p>
<p>They both laughed, and then Lady Hamilton
said more seriously, &#8220;Shall I tell you why I
won&#8217;t go?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, do, if you know, yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know perfectly. I won&#8217;t go to the Terrace
because I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ll meet my father there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For goodness&#8217; sake! Is that the real reason?
But you <i>want</i> to be reconciled to him!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but you don&#8217;t understand. We couldn&#8217;t
have a &#8216;Come home and all will be forgiven&#8217;
scene on the Terrace, in sight of hundreds of
people, so if I did see him, I should have to
bow slightly, or cut him dead; it would depend
on his attitude toward me which I did. <i>Then</i>
the episode would merely serve to widen the
breach, and it would break me up for days.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t understand such conditions,&#8221; said
Patty, earnestly. &#8220;Why, if I were at odds with
my father, and I can&#8217;t even imagine such a
thing, I&#8217;d rush at him and fling myself into his
arms and stay there till everything was all
right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just because you&#8217;re of a different temperament,
and so is your father. My father is
an austere, unbending man, and if I were on the
Terrace and were to fling myself into his arms,
he&#8217;d very likely fling me into the Thames.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d probably be rescued,&#8221; said Patty,
gravely; &#8220;there&#8217;s always so much traffic.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but father wouldn&#8217;t jump in to rescue
me, so I&#8217;d only spoil my gown for nothing.
Give it up, dear, it&#8217;s a case outside your experience.
Father and I are both too proud to make
the first advance, and yet I really believe he
wants me as much as I want him. He must be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
very lonely in the great house, with only the
servants to look after him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps he&#8217;ll marry again,&#8221; said Patty,
thoughtfully; &#8220;my father did.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish he would, but I&#8217;ve no hope of that.
Now, never mind about my troubles, tell me of
your own. Who&#8217;s taking you to the tea?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Hastings. But she isn&#8217;t giving it.
We&#8217;re to sit at some Member&#8217;s table; I don&#8217;t
know whose. The Merediths will be there, too.
Tom and Grace, you know. I like them very
much.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they&#8217;re nice children. I know them
slightly. Patty, some day I&#8217;ll give a party for
you, here in my rooms. How would you like
that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Lady Kitty, I&#8217;d love it! You&#8217;d have to
come to that, wouldn&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed, you couldn&#8217;t drive me away.
Let&#8217;s have a children&#8217;s party. All dress as children,
I mean; little children, or babies.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just the thing! I always wanted to see a
party like that. I&#8217;ve only heard of them. Can
we have it soon?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Next week, I think. I&#8217;ll consult Mrs.
Betham, and I think I can coax her &#8217;round to it;
though she&#8217;s bound to wet-blanket it at first.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, you can coax her, I know. How
good you are to me! I do have beautiful times.
Really too many for one girl. Honestly, Lady
Kitty, do you think it&#8217;s right for me to lead
such a butterfly life? I just fly about from one
entertainment to another; and even if I&#8217;m at
home, or alone, I always have a good time.
Sometimes I think I&#8217;m a very useless member
of this busy world.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lady Hamilton smiled kindly. &#8220;How old are
you?&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be eighteen next month.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you haven&#8217;t set the Thames on fire, or
won the Victoria Cross yet? But you&#8217;re just at
the age when your type of happy girlhood is
often beset with over-conscientious scruples.
Don&#8217;t give way to them, Patty. It is not your
lot to do definite, physical good to suffering
humanity, like a Red Cross nurse, or the Salvation
Army. Nor is it necessary that you should
work to earn your bread, like a teacher or a
stenographer. But it is your duty, or rather
your privilege, to shed sunshine wherever you
go. I think I&#8217;ve never known any one with such
a talent for spontaneous and unconscious giving-out
of happiness. It is involuntary, which is its
chiefest charm, but whoever is with you for a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
time is cheered and comforted just by the influence
of your own gladness. This is honest talk,
my child, and I want you to take it as I mean
it. Don&#8217;t <i>try</i> to do this thing, that would spoil
it all; but just remember that you <i>do</i> do it, and
let that satisfy your desire to be a useful member
of this busy world.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re such a dear,&#8221; said Patty, as she
caressed her friend&#8217;s hand affectionately; &#8220;if
that&#8217;s all true, and of course it is, since you say
so, I&#8217;m very glad. But can&#8217;t I do something
more definite, more voluntary?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course there are always opportunities for
doing good,&mdash;organised charities and those
things that everybody takes part in. But if you
want to widen your own field of benefaction,
simply know more people. Whether you know
them socially or as casual acquaintances, you will
almost invariably add happiness to their lives,
though it be in the merest trifles. Now, I&#8217;m assuming
that you have sense enough not to overdo
this thing, and thrust yourself upon people who
don&#8217;t want you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Madam,&#8221; said Patty, in mock indignation,
&#8220;you may trust me. I am an
American!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are indeed; and you have what is known
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
as Yankee good sense, if you are a mere infant.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eighteen is pretty old, <i>I</i> think; and you&#8217;re
not so very ancient, yourself,&#8221; retorted Patty;
&#8220;but I&#8217;m willing to sit at your feet and acquire
wisdom.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When dressed to go out that afternoon, Patty
stopped at Lady Hamilton&#8217;s door to say good-bye.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in, and let me see if you&#8217;ll pass muster.
Yes, that frilly, flowered muslin is just right for
the Terrace; and that hat with long streamers
is truly pastoral.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s pastoral about the Terrace,
pray?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing but the ladies&#8217; clothes, and the
lamb-like demeanour of the M.P.&#8217;s.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I may see your father there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You may. But he&#8217;ll be an exception to the
lamb-like ones. Here, let me put these valley
lilies in your belt. They rather suit your costume.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you; they&#8217;re beautiful. If I see
your father, I&#8217;ll give him a spray and say you
sent it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well; he&#8217;ll then pitch you and the flowers
all in the Thames together.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
&#8220;Well, at least we&#8217;ll cause a sensation among
the lambs. Good-by, Kitty lady.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye, little one. Have a good time, and
come in to tell me about it when you return.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The tea on the Terrace was a new delight.
Patty had been through the Houses of Parliament
before, but this was her first experience
of that unique function known as the Terrace
Tea.
</p>
<p>The broad, beautiful space was crowded with
tables, and the tables were crowded with people.
Merry, chatting, laughing Londoners, Americans,
and foreigners mingled in groups and
drank tea together.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings and Patty were met by their
host, Mr. Pauncefote, and escorted to a table,
already surrounded by several people.
</p>
<p>Patty felt greatly pleased when she found herself
seated between Grace and Tom Meredith,
and listened with interest as they designated
various celebrated people who were strolling by.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, after all,&#8221; she said, at last, &#8220;Dukes and
Duchesses don&#8217;t look very different from ordinary
people.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course they don&#8217;t. Why should they?
They aren&#8217;t any different,&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;Indeed,
Miss Fairfield, I&#8217;ve vanity enough to believe
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
you&#8217;d find me more interesting than some
of the Dukes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you are,&#8221; laughed Patty, &#8220;but if I
were introduced to a real Duke, I&#8217;d be so
scared I wouldn&#8217;t know what to say.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I call that too bad,&#8221; declared Tom, with
an aggrieved look. &#8220;And, pray, why aren&#8217;t you
scared when in my august society?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; said Patty, dimpling, as she smiled
at him, &#8220;only I&#8217;m successfully striving not to
show my quaking fright.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s better. I hope the longer you know
me, the more awed you&#8217;ll be of my,&mdash;of
my&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of your what?&#8221; calmly inquired his sister.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Pon my word, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; confessed
Tom, good-naturedly; &#8220;of my awesomeness, I
suppose.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you like London?&#8221; said a loud
voice, in the tones that are sometimes called
stentorian, and Patty suddenly realised that her
host was addressing her.
</p>
<p>A bit embarrassed at finding the eyes of all at
the table upon her, she answered, shyly: &#8220;I love
it; it is so&mdash;so kind to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bravo! Pretty good for an American,&#8221;
shouted Mr. Pauncefote, who seemed unable to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
moderate his voice. &#8220;And which do you like
best, the people or the show-places?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The people,&#8221; said Patty, her embarrassment
lost sight of in a flash of mischief. &#8220;I like the
Members of Parliament better than Parliament
House.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good! Good!&#8221; cried the portly M.P.,
striking the table with his fist until the cups
rattled; &#8220;that&#8217;s true Yankee cleverness. You&#8217;re
a good sort, my child. Are they all like you in
America?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I think so,&#8221; said Patty, demurely; &#8220;are
they all like you in England?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty&#8217;s innocent air of inquiry robbed the
speech of all effect of pertness, and the genial
Mr. Pauncefote roared with delight.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha, ha!&#8221; he cried; &#8220;all like me in England?
No, my child, no! Heaven be praised, there
are very few after my pattern.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s too bad,&#8221; said Patty. &#8220;I think your
pattern is a good one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; said Tom Meredith. &#8220;If we had
more statesmen after Mr. Pauncefote&#8217;s pattern,
the House of Commons would be better off.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This speech called forth applause from the
other guests, and the host said, loudly: &#8220;Pshaw,
pshaw!&#8221; but he looked greatly pleased.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></p>
<p>When the tea was over and the party rose from
the table, Mr. Pauncefote detained Patty for a
moment&#8217;s chat, while the others broke up into
smaller groups or wandered away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to meet my daughter,&#8221; he was
saying; &#8220;the young lady in gray over there,
talking to Sir Otho.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir Otho who?&#8221; said Patty, quickly, forgetting
to respond in regard to Miss Pauncefote.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir Otho Markleham; see the large gentleman
with gold-rimmed glasses. She is my
youngest daughter, and I know she&#8217;d be glad to
meet you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be delighted,&#8221; said Patty, but her attention
centred on Sir Otho.
</p>
<p>Could it be that was Lady Hamilton&#8217;s severe
father? He did not look so obstinate as she
had imagined him, but as she drew nearer, she
observed the firm set of his square jaw and reversed
her opinion.
</p>
<p>Sir Otho was very tall and big, and his
smoothly brushed hair was light brown without
a trace of gray.
</p>
<p>He wore closely-trimmed whiskers, of the style
known as &#8220;mutton-chop,&#8221; and his cold gray
eyes almost glittered as he looked through his
glasses. The introduction to Miss Pauncefote
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
implied also an introduction to Sir Otho, and
in a moment Patty found herself chatting in a
group of which Lady Kitty&#8217;s father was one.
</p>
<p>There was something about the big man that
awed her, and she naturally fell into conversation
with Miss Pauncefote, while the two gentlemen
talked together. But as they were all about
to separate, and even after Sir Otho had said
good-afternoon, Patty hesitated irresolutely for
a second, and then turned back toward him
again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir Otho,&#8221; she said, timidly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, ma&#8217;am, what is it?&#8221; was the response
as he turned in surprise to look at her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very glad to meet you,&#8221; said Patty,
and as soon as the words were uttered, she realised
how absurd they were.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; said the puzzled gentleman.
He was very unresponsive, and showed
in his face that he thought little of this exhibition
of American forwardness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Especially so,&#8221; Patty went on, &#8220;because I
know your daughter, Lady Hamilton.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless my soul!&#8221; ejaculated Sir Otho Markleham,
the red blood dyeing his large face crimson,
and his eyes fairly snapping with anger.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I do,&#8221; went on Patty, resolved now to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
plunge in desperately, &#8220;and she sent you these
flowers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty had previously detached two or three of
the prettiest sprays of the lilies of the valley, and
now held them out, with the air of one fulfilling
a trust.
</p>
<p>For a moment Sir Otho Markleham looked as
if he would really like to pitch the American
girl and her flowers into the river, and then,
almost mechanically, he took the blossoms from
Patty&#8217;s hand.
</p>
<p>Then, with a straight, cold stare at her, he
said, in a hard voice: &#8220;I have no daughter,&#8221;
and after a stiff, formal bow, he walked away.

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>MISS YANKEE DOODLE</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t, really!&#8221; exclaimed Lady
Hamilton, as Patty gleefully described
giving the flowers to Sir Otho Markleham.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I did, Kitty, and truly, he <i>was</i> mad
enough to pitch me into that yellow muddy
old river. I greatly admire his self-control in
not really doing it. But what eyes he has! So
gray and steely, they cut right through me!
And he just said, tragically, &#8216;I have no
daughter,&#8217; and stalked away. But&mdash;and this is
the main thing&mdash;he kept the flowers!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I watched him. I fully expected he&#8217;d fling
them straight over Parliament House, but he
didn&#8217;t. He didn&#8217;t even throw them on the stone
floor of the Terrace, and gr-r-rind them &#8217;neath
his iron heel! I can&#8217;t say that he put them in
his button-hole, for his back was toward me, but
I <i>know</i> he kept them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Patty, you are a silly! You think you&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
gone far toward healing the family feud of the
Marklehams. But you haven&#8217;t. My father
gave the whole episode no thought at all, unless
it was to think of you as an impertinent child.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it was a wedge,&#8221; said Patty, doggedly,
&#8220;and if I ever get another chance at him, I&#8217;ll
hammer it in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, don&#8217;t, Patty dear; you mean well, I
know, but you don&#8217;t know father&#8217;s disposition.
If he thought you were an intermediary, he&#8217;d be
more stubborn than ever.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; said Patty, more expressively than
politely; &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to make any trouble.
Trust your Aunt Patty for that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lady Hamilton laughed, as she always did at
Patty&#8217;s funny American phrases, and the subject
of Sir Otho was dropped.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Better not mix yourself up in other people&#8217;s
quarrels,&#8221; said Mr. Fairfield, when Patty told
him about it. &#8220;Your motive is a good one, but
an Englishman is not apt to brook interference
from an outsider, especially an American.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, pshaw, Fred; Patty won&#8217;t do any
harm,&#8221; said Nan. &#8220;Patty&#8217;s tact is a match for
any English temper, and if she could bring
about a reconciliation, I&#8217;d be so glad for that
sweet Lady Hamilton.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></p>
<p>&#8220;All right; I give in. When you two are
against me, I hold up my hands.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not against you, Daddy,&#8221; said Patty,
smiling fondly at her father. &#8220;You&#8217;re on our
side, only you don&#8217;t quite realise it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you she had tact,&#8221; laughed Nan, &#8220;and
she grows cleverer every day; don&#8217;t you, Stepdaughter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Stepmother,&#8221; replied Patty, gazing at
Nan in mock adoration; &#8220;since I have you for
a model, how could I do otherwise?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a pair of sillies,&#8221; said Mr. Fairfield,
laughing at their nonsense, &#8220;and in a vain endeavour
to improve your minds, I think I&#8217;ll read
aloud to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, goody!&#8221; cried Patty, for they both loved
to hear Mr. Fairfield read. &#8220;And mayn&#8217;t I ask
Lady Kitty to come in? She&#8217;ll sit still as a
mouse, I know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, my child; ask any one you like.
If you see any people in the corridors, bring them
back with you. Perhaps the elevator man will
come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Deed he won&#8217;t be asked,&#8221; said Patty, indignantly.
&#8220;I just want my sweet, lovely Lady
Kitty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The sweet, lovely lady was pleased to come,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
and did indeed sit still as a mouse, listening to
Mr. Fairfield&#8217;s fine reading.
</p>
<p>Then Patty sang one or two of her newest
songs, and then Nan declared they must all go
down to the Grill Room for a Welsh Rabbit.
</p>
<p>This plan enchanted Patty, and after a moment&#8217;s
hesitation, Lady Hamilton agreed. So
the evening proved a merry little festivity, and
Patty went to bed healthily tired, but healthily
happy.
</p>
<p>Bob Hartley did not forget his promise to ask
Patty to the Garden Party at Regent&#8217;s Park,
and Patty gladly accepted the invitation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The only thing that bothers me,&#8221; she said to
Nan, &#8220;is that the Hartleys don&#8217;t seem to have
much money, and at a Charity Garden Party
there are so many ways to spend, that I fear I&#8217;ll
be a burden to them. It makes me awfully uncomfortable,
and yet I can&#8217;t offer to pay for
myself. And with those young men present, I
can&#8217;t offer to pay for the whole party.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; agreed Nan. &#8220;But you might do something
yourself. Invite them all to be your guests
at some especial side-show, or booth. There
are often such opportunities.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope there will be. The Hartleys are a
funny kind of poor. They have a good apartment
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
in London, and their country place is fine.
They have old servants, and keep a carriage,
and all that, and yet they never seem to have
spending money.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;English people are often like that. The keeping
up of an establishment comes first with them,
and little personal comforts afterward.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t my idea of economy,&#8221; said Patty,
decidedly; &#8220;I&#8217;d rather spend all I want on flowers
and books and pretty hats, and go without
a butler and a footman and even a team of
horses.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t judge, because you&#8217;ve always had
whatever you want.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course; because father is indulgent and
has plenty of money. But if he hadn&#8217;t, I&#8217;d be
just as happy, living in a plainer way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Patty, I believe you would,&#8221; and Nan
looked at the girl affectionately. &#8220;Well, do
your best to help the Hartleys financially this
afternoon without offending them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, that&#8217;s just the trouble. They&#8217;re so
dreadfully proud they won&#8217;t accept so much as
a glass of lemonade from one who is their
guest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Try it, and see. It may not be so difficult
as you think.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></p>
<p>So Patty went gaily off to the Garden Party.
Mrs. Hartley called for her in her carriage.
Mabel was with her, and they were to meet the
boys at the park.
</p>
<p>It was a beautiful drive, in the open victoria,
along the busy streets of the city, and then on
out to the green slopes of Regent&#8217;s Park.
</p>
<p>The portion of the park devoted to the Garden
Party was gay with booths and flower-stands,
tents and arbours, and catch-penny shows of all
sorts.
</p>
<p>Sinclair and Robert were awaiting them, and
also another young Englishman, whom Bob introduced
as Mr. Lawton. The latter was a
typical Briton, with a slight drawl, and a queer-looking
monocle in his right eye.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Awfully jolly to meet you,&#8221; he exclaimed, as
he shook Mrs. Hartley&#8217;s hand, and bowed formally
to the girls.
</p>
<p>He fascinated Patty, he was so exactly like
the young Englishmen pictured in <i>Punch</i>, and
she waited to hear him say &#8220;Bah Jove!&#8221; But
he didn&#8217;t say it, he contented himself with &#8220;My
word!&#8221; by way of expletive, and though it
didn&#8217;t seem to mean anything, it was apparently
useful to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must jolly well let me be your guide,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
he declared; &#8220;Mrs. Hartley and I will lead
and the rest of you will follow wherever we
go. First, we make the grand tour.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This meant joining a long procession that were
sauntering along a board walk, on either side
of which were settees filled with people.
</p>
<p>Patty, with Sinclair, followed the leaders, and
Mabel and Bob followed them.
</p>
<p>But their progress was slow, for continually
some of the party recognised friends seated
alongside, and stopped to speak to them. Patty
was introduced so often that she became bewildered,
and soon stopped trying to remember
who was who.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re getting jolly well fagged,&#8221; said Mr.
Lawton, suddenly noticing her expression.
&#8220;Now, we&#8217;ll stop this merry-go-round and adjourn
to the tea tent.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This they did, and were soon comfortably
seated round a tea table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Great show, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; said Bob, enthusiastically.
&#8220;And you haven&#8217;t seen half of it yet.
There&#8217;s fortune-telling, and Punch and Judy,
and the hat-trimming contest, and I don&#8217;t know
what beside.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sinclair adroitly paid the tea bill, before Mr.
Lawton could do so, though the latter tried.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, old fellow,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;I&#8217;ll get
even with you! I hereby invite you all to
supper at six o&#8217;clock.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re pleased to accept,&#8221; said Patty,
promptly; &#8220;and I hereby invite you all to the
play, or whatever it is, given by the Stagefright
Club. I think that&#8217;s such a lovely name for a
dramatic club. Can&#8217;t we go at once?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hartley looked a little disturbed at
Patty&#8217;s invitation, but did not demur, and tea
being over, they all went toward the tent where
the play was to be given. Patty managed to
walk ahead with Mr. Lawton, this time, and
when they reached the big tent, she offered him
her little gold chain-purse, saying, quietly,
&#8220;Won&#8217;t you see to the tickets, please?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Trust me,&#8221; said Mr. Lawton, and taking
Patty&#8217;s purse, he bought seats for them all. It
was gracefully done, and they all went in in
gay spirits and without a trace of embarrassment,
thanks to Patty&#8217;s tact.
</p>
<p>The play was very funny. Though only a
trifling farce, it was written by professionals, for
the benefit of the charity, and was played by the
clever amateurs who had chosen such an odd
name for their club. The situations in the play
were screamingly funny, and Patty shook with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
laughter as she listened to the jokes and the
merry by-play.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hist, she comes!&#8221; declared a weird figure in
a sepulchral voice, as he waited in the middle
of the stage.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hist, she comes!&#8221;
</p>
<p>But nobody came.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s her cue,&#8221; he muttered; &#8220;what can be
the matter? I say,&#8221; he cleared his throat and
spoke louder: &#8220;Hist, she comes!&#8221; As the expected
entrance was still delayed, he only said:
&#8220;Well, she ought to be hissed when she does
come!&#8221; And calmly sat down to wait for her,
amid the applause of the audience.
</p>
<p>The short playlet soon came to an end, and
still shaking with laughter, the party went out
again into the beautiful atmosphere which is
found on a spring day in Regent&#8217;s Park.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, my children,&#8221; said Mrs. Hartley, &#8220;I
simply cannot walk about any more. I&#8217;m going
to sit in one of those chairs yonder, for I see
some people I know over there. You can amuse
yourselves with Punch and Judy, or Ring Toss
or whatever you like, and come back to me in an
hour or so. Sinclair, look after the little ones,
won&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was a great joke that Sinclair, the oldest
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
Hartley boy, should look after the others. He
had reached the age of twenty, and was much
more grave and dignified than Bob and Grace.
Mrs. Hartley often declared she could even
trust him to match samples for her, so careful
was he. So the young people wandered away
and spent a delightful hour looking at the beautiful
or grotesque sights that adorned the fair.
</p>
<p>Patty could not do much financially, but under
cover of giving to charity, she bought pretty
souvenirs for Mabel and Mrs. Hartley, and
laughingly invited the group to be photographed
by a Camera Fiend.
</p>
<p>This personage was clothed in red, and with
black horns and Mephistophelean countenance
was made to look as much like a fiend as possible.
With outlandish hoots and yells, he posed
the group and took several snapshots, which
they were to call for later.
</p>
<p>As they concluded it was nearly time to drift
back to Mrs. Hartley, Patty noticed a gentleman
who stood at a little distance, looking at
her intently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s your friend, Patty?&#8221; asked Mabel.
&#8220;Do you know him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Patty, slowly. &#8220;He&#8217;s Sir Otho
Markleham.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></p>
<p>&#8220;So he is,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen him often,
but I don&#8217;t know him personally.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sir Otho, still looking at Patty, took a few
steps toward her, and then paused irresolutely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Please excuse me,&#8221; said Patty to the others,
&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll go speak to him for a minute.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do,&#8221; said Mr. Lawton; &#8220;we&#8217;ll wait for you
right here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Following an impulse, Patty walked directly toward
Sir Otho, who looked as if he would like
to run away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you do?&#8221; she said, pleasantly, as
they met.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite well,&#8221; he said, but there was no responsiveness
in his manner. &#8220;Do you wish to
speak to me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Now after he had first advanced toward Patty,
this was a strange question, but she bravely took
up the burden of conversation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, yes,&#8221; she said, smiling at him prettily;
&#8220;I want to ask you how you are enjoying the
Garden Party.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never enjoy anything,&#8221; he returned, but his
face was sad now, rather than angry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, what a pity!&#8221; said Patty, involuntarily,
&#8220;and you have such powers of enjoyment,
too.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know that, Miss Yankee
Doodle?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty didn&#8217;t altogether like the name, or rather
the tone in which it was said, but she was determined
not to get piqued. So she said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, because you&#8217;re such a big, healthy,
hearty-looking man; you ought to laugh most of
the time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ought I, indeed? But you see I never have
anything to laugh at.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At this Patty laughed outright.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, the world is full of things to laugh at,&mdash;and
you&#8217;re not blind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but I don&#8217;t feel like laughing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you ever even feel like smiling?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not often.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you feel like smiling just a little bit
of a happy smile, when I gave you those flowers
the other day? Those flowers&mdash;from Kitty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sir Otho&#8217;s face grew dark.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How dare you mention her name to me?&#8221;
he cried. &#8220;You are a saucy minx! Go away!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t be sent away like that,&#8221; declared
Patty, looking haughty now. &#8220;I&#8217;m no child to
be scolded for nothing. How dare you speak
to me like that? What do you think I am?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sir Otho turned red with rage. He choked
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
and stammered and looked like a choleric old
gentleman, as indeed he was.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;re an impertinent Yankee. What
do you think I am?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty looked him squarely in the eye. Her
chance had come, and she did not flinch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; she said, looking steadfastly at
him, &#8220;I think you&#8217;re an obstinate, stubborn,
selfish, cruel old&mdash;Pighead!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She confessed, afterward, that at that moment
she fully expected the irate old man to strike
her. But he did not. Instead, he looked at her
just a moment in amazement, and then burst
into peals of laughter.
</p>
<p>Surprised beyond measure, but unable to
resist the infectious merriment, Patty laughed
too.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Miss Yankee Doodle,&#8221; said Sir Otho,
wiping his eyes, &#8220;you are most astonishing.
The strange part is, you are quite right. I <i>am</i>
a stubborn old Pighead, but how did you know
it? Do I wear my heart on my sleeve to that
extent?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you a heart?&#8221; asked Patty, so gravely
that Sir Otho again roared with laughter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet,&#8221; said Patty, thoughtfully, seeing
that frankness pleased the old man, &#8220;and yet,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
no one with such a sense of humour as you
seem to have can be wholly bad.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you! So I&#8217;m not wholly bad?
Well, that&#8217;s a comfort; I always thought I was.
But your friends are looking this way. I think
they want you to rejoin them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In a moment,&#8221; said Patty. &#8220;Sir Otho,&mdash;won&#8217;t
you&mdash;please&mdash;send a flower back to my
friend, Lady Hamilton?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I would do much for any friend of yours,&#8221;
said the strange old man, very gravely, and
taking a few steps to a nearby flower stand, he
bought a bunch of sweet peas, and said, carelessly,
&#8220;Give her those, if you like.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then formally escorting Patty back to her
friends, he raised his hat, and walked quickly
away.

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>HERENDEN HALL</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;There, Kitty lady,&#8221; said Patty, as she
reached the Savoy on her return from
the Garden Party, &#8220;there&#8217;s a nosegay
from your affectionate father.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lady Hamilton stared at the bunch of sweet
peas that Patty held out to her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My word!&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;you are the
most amazing child! I suppose he sent them
to me just about as much as I sent him those
valley lilies you took to him the other day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lady Kitty guessed so near the truth that
Patty felt a little crestfallen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was more than that,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I asked
him to send some flowers to you, and he bought
these purposely.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he select sweet peas, himself?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That means something, then, Patty dear; for
father well knows my fondness for these flowers.
Well, you&#8217;re a dear, good little girl to try to
heal the breach, but I can&#8217;t feel much encouragement.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
Father is too old and too obstinate ever
to forgive me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re too young and too obstinate to
go and beg his forgiveness!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed I am! Fancy my meekly returning,
like a prodigal daughter, when I haven&#8217;t done
anything wrong!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t deserve a reconciliation,&#8221; cried
Patty; &#8220;you&#8217;re a hard-hearted little thing,&mdash;for
all you look so soft and amiable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Lady Kitty, demurely; &#8220;I inherited
my father&#8217;s disposition.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, you did; and you&#8217;ll grow more like
him every day you live, if you don&#8217;t try to be
more forgiving.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you&#8217;re right, Patty; and perhaps
some day I will try. But now let me tell you
what&#8217;s been happening. While you were away,
I had a call from that very charming stepmother
of yours. And this was the burden of her visit.
It seems that she and your father are invited
to spend the week-end at a country house, and
the question was, where to pack you away for
safe-keeping while they&#8217;re gone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And they&#8217;re going to let me stay with you!&#8221;
exclaimed Patty, clasping her hands and assuming
an ecstatically happy expression.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mrs. Nan seemed to think that I
could keep you in order, though I&#8217;m not so sure
of it myself. But the strange part is, I also am
invited for this same week-end to a most delightful
country house, and I have already accepted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty&#8217;s face fell.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is to become of poor little me?&#8221; she
said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to stay with Mrs. Betham.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I&#8217;ve a plan for you. And it&#8217;s this. I
want to take you with me to Herenden Hall,
where I&#8217;m going, and,&mdash;Mrs. Nan says I may.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Kitty! You duck! How perfectly
lovely!&#8221; Patty flew at her friend, and nearly
strangled her in a spasmodic embrace.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; went on Lady Hamilton, when she
had regained her breath, &#8220;I&#8217;m so well acquainted
with the Herendens, that I can ask
an invitation for you; and though you&#8217;re not
really &#8216;out&#8217; yet, it will give you a glimpse of
the nicest kind of English country-house life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s great!&#8221; declared Patty. &#8220;I&#8217;m wild with
excitement. But I care more about being with
you than I do about the house-party.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t when you get there. They&#8217;re
really charming people, and the Hall is one of
the finest old estates in England.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I have to have some new frocks?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll look over your wardrobe, and see. I
fancy the ones you already have will do. You
know you&#8217;ll be looked upon as scarcely more
than a schoolgirl, and you must wear simple,
frilly muslins and broad-leafed hats.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can even live through that! I don&#8217;t care
what I wear if I&#8217;m with you. Three whole
days! Will it be three days, Kitty?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Three days or more. If they politely ask
us to remain a day or two longer we might do
so. They&#8217;re old friends of mine, do you see?
And I haven&#8217;t been there for years, so they&#8217;ll be
glad to see us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To see you, you mean. They don&#8217;t know
me, so how can they be glad to see me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you must,&mdash;what is your idiotic American
phrase? You must &#8216;make good&#8217;!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; said Patty, laughing to hear the
phrase from an Englishwoman, and then she
ran away to her own apartment, to talk over
affairs with Nan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a great piece of good fortune,&#8221; said Nan,
&#8220;that you&#8217;re such good friends with Lady
Hamilton, for Fred and I couldn&#8217;t take you with
us, and what would have become of you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I always land on my feet,&#8221; returned
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
Patty, &#8220;I must have been born under a lucky
star.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you were, Pattykins.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And won&#8217;t I have the time of my life at
Herenden Hall&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Patty, Patty, you must stop using slang.
They&#8217;ll never ask you to Herenden Hall again
if you behave like a wild Indian.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you see, Stepmother, they look upon me
as an infant anyhow, so I may as well have
some fun.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t be a hoyden, and do remember that
American slang isn&#8217;t admired over here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yas&#8217;m; I&#8217;ll be good. And I&#8217;ll say &#8216;Really?&#8217;
and &#8216;Only fancy!&#8217; till they&#8217;ll think I&#8217;m the
daughter of a hundred Earls.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not at all worried about your manners,&#8221;
said Nan, serenely. &#8220;You usually behave pretty
well, but you will talk American instead of English.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll try to make myself understood, at
all events. And you&#8217;re going to have a lovely
time, too, aren&#8217;t you? Isn&#8217;t it fun! I do like
to have all my friends as happy as I am. I suppose
you and father will be like two young
turtle-doves off on your honeymoon trip.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re always that, even when there&#8217;s a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
great, big girl like you around to make us seem
old.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if you behave as well as you look, I
won&#8217;t be ashamed of you.&#8221; Patty gazed critically
at Nan, and then added, &#8220;Though your
nose does seem to turn up more than it used to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Whereupon Nan threw a sofa-pillow at her,
which Patty caught and stuffed behind her own
curly head.
</p>
<p>The Saturday of their departure was a beautiful,
bright day, and it was about noon when
Patty and Lady Hamilton, accompanied by the
latter&#8217;s maid, took the train from Victoria
Station.
</p>
<p>It was a long ride to their destination in Kent,
and not an especially interesting one, but Patty,
in the companionship of her dear friend, was entirely
happy. They chatted gaily as the train
rolled from one English town to another. At
Robertsbridge they had to change to a funny
little railroad, which had the strangest cars
Patty had ever seen.
</p>
<p>They were almost like freight cars, with
benches along the sides. There were no tickets,
and presently the guard came in to collect their
fares, as if in a street-car.
</p>
<p>Moreover the luggage had been tumbled in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
without check or paster, and Patty wondered
if anybody ever could pick out their own again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your regular first-class coaches are funny
enough,&#8221; she said to Lady Hamilton, &#8220;but they
are comfortable. This box we&#8217;re in is like a
cattle pen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; laughed Lady Hamilton; &#8220;this isn&#8217;t
bad at all. You see it&#8217;s only a tiny branch road,
running to some little hamlets, and it&#8217;s not much
used. There are only about two trains each
way every day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This gave Patty a different idea of the little
railroad, and she began to feel a more personal
interest in it. They rolled slowly through the
hop-growing country, and though the scenery
was not grand, it was picturesque. Patty said
it was like a panorama of &#8220;The Angelus.&#8221;
They reached their station at about five o&#8217;clock,
and found a fine open barouche awaiting them,
and a wagon for their trunks.
</p>
<p>The footman greeted them deferentially, and
asked them to pick out their luggage from the lot
that had been dumped on the station platform.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see either of my trunks,&#8221; said Patty.
&#8220;So I suppose I&#8217;d better take the ones I like best
of these others.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; said Lady Hamilton; &#8220;yours
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
must be here somewhere. Look around, Marie;
you know Miss Fairfield&#8217;s boxes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, my Lady; but they are not here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sure enough, they weren&#8217;t there, and as Patty
was certain they had been put on the train, she
concluded they had been carried on.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What can I do?&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Can we telephone
to the next station and have them sent
back?&#8221;
</p>
<p>But in that small station, merely a tiny box,
there was no telephone.
</p>
<p>The impassive coachman and footman from
Herenden Hall seemed to have no advice to
offer, so there was nothing to do but to proceed
to the house.
</p>
<p>Patty was distressed at the outlook.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Kitty,&#8221; she said; &#8220;I can&#8217;t go to dinner
at all! Of course I couldn&#8217;t appear in this
travelling costume, and I&#8217;ll have to put on one
of your négligées, and eat dinner all alone in
my room!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The prospect was appalling, but neither of
them could think of any help for it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Has Lady Herenden any daughters about my
age?&#8221; Patty asked, after a few moments&#8217;
thought.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed. She and Lord Herenden have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
no children. But if there are any young girls
there as guests, you might borrow a frock for
to-night. Surely they&#8217;ll get your things by to-morrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They drove into the park, through great gates,
and past various lodges. The wonderful old
trees waved above their heads; the marvellous
lawns stretched away in rolling slopes; and the
well-kept road wound along, now over a bridge,
now under an arch until they paused at the noble
old entrance of Herenden Hall.
</p>
<p>Liveried servants seemed to appear, as if by
magic, from all directions at once. Dogs came,
barking a noisy welcome, and, following Lady
Hamilton across the terrace and into the great
entrance hall, Patty found herself being presented
to a lovely young woman, almost as beautiful
as Lady Hamilton herself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must be the greatest chums,&#8221; Lady
Hamilton was saying, &#8220;for Miss Fairfield is one
of my dearest friends, and I want you to adore
each other.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We will!&#8221; said Lady Herenden and Patty,
at the same moment, and then they all laughed,
and the guests were at once shown to their
rooms.
</p>
<p>After a bewildering route through several
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
branching halls, Patty found that to her had
been assigned a large and pleasant room, which
looked out upon the rose-garden. On one side
it communicated with Lady Hamilton&#8217;s room,
and on the other opened into a dainty dressing-room
and bath. It was all enchanting, and
Patty&#8217;s gaze rested admiringly upon the chintz
draperies and Dresden ornaments, when she
heard a tap at her door. Answering, she found
a trim maid, who courtesied and said: &#8220;I&#8217;m
Susan, Miss. Will you give me the keys of
your boxes, and I&#8217;ll unpack them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty almost laughed at this casual request, in
the face of what seemed to her a tragedy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Susan,&#8221; she said, &#8220;here are the keys, but you
can&#8217;t unpack my boxes for they haven&#8217;t
come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lor&#8217;, Miss; they must be downstairs. I&#8217;ll
have them sent up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;wait, Susan; they&#8217;re not downstairs.
They didn&#8217;t come on the train.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lor&#8217;, Miss, whatever will you do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s eyes grew big and troubled. Here
was a dreadful situation indeed! Already Susan
felt drawn toward the pretty young American
girl, and she was aghast at the outlook of a dinner
party with no party frock.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t go to dinner at all, Susan,&#8221; said Patty,
dejectedly. &#8220;You must bring me a tray up
here&mdash;though I don&#8217;t feel like eating.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not go to dinner, Miss? Oh, what a pity!
It&#8217;s a grand dinner to-night. The Earl of Ruthven
is here, and it&#8217;s one of her ladyship&#8217;s greatest
dinners of the season.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The good Susan looked so concerned, and her
face was so anxious, that it went straight to
Patty&#8217;s heart. To her mind there came a vivid
and tantalising remembrance of her exquisite
dinner frock, of white chiffon, embroidered with
tiny sprays of blossoms&mdash;a soft sash and
shoulder-knots&mdash;one of the loveliest dresses she
had ever had, and with a sob she threw herself
on to the couch and indulged in a few foolish
but comforting tears.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There, there, Miss,&#8221; said Susan, sympathisingly,
&#8220;don&#8217;t ee take on so. Maybe we can
find summat for ee.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When Susan was excited or troubled, she lapsed
into her old dialect, which she was striving to
outgrow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t find anything, I know,&#8221; said Patty,
sitting up, and looking the picture of woe.
&#8220;There are no very young ladies in the house,
are there, Susan?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, Miss, none so young as yourself, nor
near it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I can&#8217;t wear this,&#8221; went on Patty, looking
at the silk blouse that was part of her
travelling gown.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lor&#8217; no, Miss; not to a dinner!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what, indeed, Miss!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty and Susan faced each other, at last in a
full realisation of the hopelessness of the situation,
when, after a light tap at the door, Lady
Hamilton came in.
</p>
<p>She laughed outright at the tragic attitude of
the two, and knew at once what they were
troubled about.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen to me, Pattypet,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Am I
your fairy godmother, or am I not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are,&#8221; said Patty, with an air of conviction,
and feeling sure that Lady Hamilton
was about to help her out of her troubles,
somehow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve carefully considered the case.
I&#8217;ve sent Marie to canvass the house for clothes
suitable for a mademoiselle of seventeen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nearly eighteen,&#8221; murmured Patty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter. There isn&#8217;t what&#8217;s known
as a &#8216;misses&#8217; costume&#8217; beneath this roof. Now,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
I simply refuse to let you be absent from this
dinner. It will be both a pleasure and an education
to you to see this especial kind of a formal
function, and probably you&#8217;ll not often have a
chance. They&#8217;ve sent a man and a wagon over
to the next station, several miles away for your
boxes; that&#8217;s the way they do things here. But
he can&#8217;t get back until long after the dinner
hour. So listen, to my command, dictum, fiat&mdash;call
it what you please, but this is what you&#8217;re
to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do anything you say, Kitty Lady, if it&#8217;s to
go to bed at once, and sleep soundly till morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing of the sort. You must and shall
attend this dinner. And&mdash;you&#8217;re going to wear
one of my gowns!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yours?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. We&#8217;re so nearly the same size that it
will fit you quite well enough. I&#8217;ve picked out
the simplest one, a white Irish point. It&#8217;s cut
princess, but all my gowns are. I&#8217;m sure Marie
can make it fit you perfectly, with a few pins or
a stitch here and there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it will fit well enough, but, Kitty, won&#8217;t
I be the grown-up! I&#8217;ve never worn a real
train in my life!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Of course it&#8217;s a lot too old for you, and
truly, I hate to have you appear in a gown like
that. But what else can we do? I won&#8217;t let you
miss the dinner&mdash;and after all, it doesn&#8217;t matter
so much. After this visit I doubt if you&#8217;ll ever
see these people again, and let them think you&#8217;re
five or six years older than you are. Who
cares?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Patty, gleefully. &#8220;I think it
will be fun. I&#8217;ll have my hair piled high on my
head. Can you do it for me, Sarah?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, Miss. I&#8217;m a hair-dresser and I&#8217;m
that glad you&#8217;re going to dinner.&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>FOR ONE NIGHT ONLY</h3>
</div>

<p>Sarah was indeed an expert hair-dresser,
and she piled up Patty&#8217;s hair in soft coils,
and twisted the curly tendrils into fluffy
puffs, and though the result was beautiful, it
made Patty look like her own older sister. A
jewelled ornament of Lady Hamilton&#8217;s crowned
the coiffure, and this gave an added effect of
dignity. The lace gown was easily made to fit its
new wearer. Marie pinned it, and sewed it,
and patted it into place, till nobody would suspect
it had not been made for Patty. But the
long lines of the Princess pattern took away all
of Patty&#8217;s usual simple girlish appearance, and
transformed her at once into a beautiful, queenly
young woman. The décolletée corsage, and the
sleeves, which were merely frills of lace, were
very becoming; and the long train, which billowed
into a frou-frou of chiffon ruffles took
away the last semblance of a girl of eighteen.
Notwithstanding her softly-curved cheeks and
throat, and her exquisite, fresh complexion,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
Patty looked quite the young woman of society
and could easily have been adjudged about
twenty-four years old.
</p>
<p>Her eyes danced, as she walked sedately
through the open door and into Lady Hamilton&#8217;s
room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My word, Patty!&#8221; exclaimed that lady,
&#8220;you&#8217;re simply stunning in that gown! You
look as if you&#8217;d been &#8216;out&#8217; for two or three
seasons. Your people would never forgive me
if they knew how I&#8217;ve dressed you up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was the only thing to do,&#8221; said Patty,
airily, as she began to draw on her arms a pair
of Lady Hamilton&#8217;s long white gloves. &#8220;The
wonder is that you had plenty of all sorts of
things to fit me out, and also that they do fit so
well. These gloves are just right, though I confess
the slippers pinch me just a speck.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Pretty never hurts,&#8217; you know,&#8221; said Lady
Hamilton, laughing. &#8220;Marie, isn&#8217;t Miss Fairfield
a picture?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Mais oui!</i> She is <i>charmante</i>. It is amazing
how the gown suits her. She is <i>très-belle!</i>&#8221;
</p>
<p>With the grown-up clothes, Patty had quite unconsciously
assumed a grown-up air. She nonchalantly
flung aside her train with just the
same gesture Lady Hamilton was wont to use,
and she carried herself with a dignity and graciousness
of manner which would have been absurd
when wearing her own simple frocks.
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<img src='images/illus-094.jpg' alt='' title='' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
&#8220;Marie pinned it and sewed it&#8221;
<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Gracious, goodness, child!&#8221; cried Lady
Hamilton. &#8220;Come down off that pedestal!
You walk like a Duchess. It won&#8217;t do, you
know, really.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean to,&#8221; said Patty; &#8220;you know I&#8217;m
a sort of chameleon. This gown makes me feel
as if I belonged in an opera-box, or had an audience
with the Queen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you goose! Stop your nonsense, and
we&#8217;ll go down to dinner. Mind, now, none of
those airs, or I&#8217;ll send you back to your room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty honestly tried to be her own simple-minded
self, and would have succeeded all right,
if Herenden Hall had not been so lavishly provided
with mirrors. On the grand staircase she
came face to face with a radiant creature, and
was about to step aside when she discovered it
was herself! Involuntarily she gazed at the reflection
of the white-gowned lady, and unconsciously
an air of serenity, almost hauteur, replaced
her usual merry smile, and with a gracious
mien she passed on down the stairs.
</p>
<p>Lady Herenden awaited them in the drawing-room.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></p>
<p>A brilliant assemblage was already there, for
Patty&#8217;s unusual costuming had caused her some
delay. After the first few introductions, Lady
Hamilton and Patty became separated, and the
guests stood about conversing in small groups.
</p>
<p>Patty chanced to fall in with some very entertaining
people, among whom was the Earl of
Ruthven.
</p>
<p>The Earl was a handsome man, tall, and of
an imposing presence.
</p>
<p>When presented to Patty, he gazed at her
with frank, though quite deferential admiration.
&#8220;So pleased to meet you, Miss Fairfield,&#8221; he
said; &#8220;I adore American ladies.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty really felt a little in awe of an Earl, as
she had never met one before, and was about to
make a shy response, when a slight movement
of her head showed her her own reflection in a
nearby mirror.
</p>
<p>Realising afresh that she was masquerading as
a society lady, a spirit of mischief suddenly took
possession of her, and she determined to throw
herself into the rôle. So, with a pretty little
toss of her head, and a charming smile, she
said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Lord Ruthven; I adore Englishmen,
too, but I know so few of them.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve not been here long, then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, only a few weeks. And there&#8217;s so much
I want to learn.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me teach you,&#8221; said his Lordship,
eagerly. &#8220;I do not think you would prove a
dull pupil.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty&#8217;s eyes smiled. &#8220;No Americans are
dull,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true; my experience has already
proved it. I&#8217;ve met six, I think, including yourself.
But what sort of things do you want to
learn?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The language, principally. I just want to
learn to say &#8216;only fancy&#8217; occasionally, and &#8216;d&#8217;y&#8217; see?&#8217;
in the middle of every sentence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not easy,&#8221; said Lord Ruthven, thoughtfully,
&#8220;but I think I can teach you in, say, about
ten lessons. When shall we begin the course?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty looked at him reproachfully. &#8220;If you
knew the American nature at all,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;you&#8217;d know that we always begin things the
moment the plan occurs to us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good! there&#8217;s no time like the present.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But just then their conversation was interrupted
by the announcement of dinner.
</p>
<p>Patty hoped she would sit at table next the
Earl, but it was not so. The nobleman was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
accorded the seat of honour at the right of his
hostess, while Patty, as a minor guest, was far
away across the table. But she found herself
between two affable and pleasant-mannered
young Englishmen, and instantly forgot all
about her titled friend.
</p>
<p>Indeed, the bewildering beauty of the scene
claimed her attention, and she fairly held her
breath as she looked about her. The great oval
room was lighted only by wax candles in crystal
chandeliers and candelabra. This made a soft,
mellow radiance quite different from gas or electricity.
On one side of the room long French
windows opened on to the terrace, through
which came the scent of roses and the sound of
plashing fountains. On the other side, only
slender pillars and arches divided the dining-room
from a conservatory, and a riotous tangle
of blossoms and foliage fairly spilled into the
room, forming almost a cascade of flowers.
</p>
<p>The great round table was a bewildering array
of gold plate, gilded glass, and exquisite china,
while on the delicate lace of the tablecloth lay
rare blossoms that seemed to have drifted from
the circular mound of flowers which formed the
low centrepiece.
</p>
<p>Twenty-four guests sat round the board, in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
chairs of gilded wicker, and as the silent, black-garbed
waiters served the viands, the scene became
as animated as it was beautiful.
</p>
<p>Patty forgot all else in her absolute enjoyment
of the fairy-like spectacle, and was only brought
back to a sense of reality by the sound of a
voice at her side. Mr. Merivale was speaking&mdash;the
young man who had escorted her out
to dinner, and who now sat at her right
hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You love beauty of detail,&#8221; he was saying
as he noted Patty&#8217;s absorption.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, isn&#8217;t it great!&#8221; she exclaimed, and then
suddenly realised that the expression was not at
all in keeping with the dignity of her Princess
gown.
</p>
<p>But Mr. Merivale seemed amused rather than
shocked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s American for &#8216;ripping,&#8217; isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; he
said, smiling. &#8220;But whatever the adjective, the
fact is the same. Lady Herenden&#8217;s dinners are
always the refinement of the spectacular.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty realised the appropriateness of this
phrase, and cudgelled her brain for an appropriate
reply. She began to think that playing
grown-up was a more difficult game than she
had supposed. Had she had on her own simple
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
little frock, Mr. Merivale would not have
talked to her like that.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you remember last season,&#8221; he went
on, &#8220;when Lady Herenden had a real pond,
with gold fish in the middle of the table, and
ferns and water lilies round the edge?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t here last season,&#8221; said Patty. &#8220;I
have never been in England until this
summer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed? I know you are an American, but
you have really an English manner.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s acquired,&#8221; said Patty, with a mischievous
twinkle in her eye. &#8220;I find my American manner
isn&#8217;t admired over here, so I assume London
airs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, you wish to be admired?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of all things!&#8221; declared naughty Patty, with
a roguish glance at the jesting young man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll probably get your wish,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;I&#8217;m jolly well ready to do my share.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This brought the colour to Patty&#8217;s cheeks, and
she turned slightly away, toward the man on her
other side.
</p>
<p>He was a slightly older man than Mr. Merivale
and was the squire of an adjoining estate.
He was quite ready to talk to his American
neighbour, and began the conversation by asking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
her if she had yet seen Lady Herenden&#8217;s
rose-orchard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Mr. Snowden,&#8221; said Patty, &#8220;I only arrived
a few hours ago, and I&#8217;ve not been round
the place at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then let me show it to you, please. I&#8217;ll
come over to-morrow morning for a stroll.
May I?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Patty, hesitatingly, for
she was uncertain what she ought to do in the
matter. &#8220;You see, I&#8217;m with Lady Hamilton,
and whatever she says&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, nonsense! She&#8217;ll spare you from her
side for an hour or two. There&#8217;s really a lot
to see.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again poor Patty realised her anomalous position.
But for her piled-up hair and her trained
gown, the man would never have dreamed of
asking her to go for a walk unchaperoned.
Patty had learned the ethics of London etiquette
for girls of eighteen, but she was not versed in
the ways of older young women.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see about it,&#8221; she said, non-committally,
and then she almost laughed outright at the
sudden thought of Mr. Snowden&#8217;s surprise
should he see her next day in one of her own
simple morning frocks of light muslin. Lady
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
Hamilton&#8217;s morning gowns were Paris affairs,
with trailing frills and long knotted ribbons.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to amuse you,&#8221; said Mr. Snowden,
a trifle piqued at her merriment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be amused, too,&#8221; she said, &#8220;if you
see me to-morrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then something in the man&#8217;s pleasant face
seemed to invite confidence, and she said, impulsively:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I may as well tell you that I&#8217;m masquerading.
I&#8217;m not a grown-up lady at all. I&#8217;m not
much more than a schoolgirl&mdash;not quite eighteen
years old. But&mdash;but my box didn&#8217;t come, and&mdash;and
I had to wear Lady Hamilton&#8217;s gown.
It makes me seem a lot older, I know, but I had
to do it, or stay away from dinner.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Snowden looked first amazed, and then
he burst into laughter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon, I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but
I had no idea! And so Lady Hamilton is your
chaperon? I see. Of course. Well, we&#8217;ll
have the stroll just the same, if you will, and
we&#8217;ll ask her to go with us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t she the dearest thing?&#8221; exclaimed
Patty, looking at Lady Kitty across the table,
and feeling much more at her ease now that she
had confessed her position.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She is a beautiful and charming woman,&#8221;
agreed Mr. Snowden.
</p>
<p>And then it was time for Patty to turn back to
Mr. Merivale, for she had learned that one
must divide the time fairly between dinner neighbors.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t offend you, did I?&#8221; said young Merivale,
eagerly. &#8220;You turned so quickly&mdash;and&mdash;and
you&mdash;er&mdash;blushed, you know, and so I was
afraid&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Patty was of no mind to confess the fewness
of her years to everybody, and her mischievous
spirit returned as she determined to
chaff this amusing young man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; she said, reproachfully, &#8220;an Englishman,
and afraid!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Afraid of nothing but a fair lady&#8217;s displeasure.
All true Englishmen surrender to that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not displeased,&#8221; said Patty, dimpling and
smiling; &#8220;in fact, I&#8217;ve even forgotten what you
said.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good! Now we can start fresh. Will
you save a lot of dances for me to-night?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, will there be dancing?&#8221; exclaimed Patty,
delighted at the prospect.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed; in the big ballroom. Will you
give me all the waltzes?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></p>
<p>Patty looked at him in amazement. &#8220;You
said you were going to &#8216;start fresh,&#8217;&#8221; she said,
&#8220;and now you&#8217;ve certainly done so!&#8221;
</p>
<p>But the American phrase was lost on the Englishman,
who only proceeded to repeat his
request.
</p>
<p>Meantime, Mr. Snowden was asking Patty for
a dance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I shall be pleased to
dance with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll give me more than one dance or you
needn&#8217;t give me any,&#8221; grumbled young Merivale.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Patty, quickly. &#8220;Mr. Snowden,
I&#8217;ve just had a dance &#8216;returned with
thanks,&#8217; so you can have that, if you wish it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do indeed,&#8221; he replied, enthusiastically, and
Mr. Merivale relapsed into a sulky silence.
</p>
<p>Then Lady Herenden rose from the table, and
the ladies all rose and followed her up to one
of the beautiful salons, where coffee was served
to them. Patty managed to secure a seat on a
divan beside Lady Hamilton.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You quite take my breath away, little Patty,&#8221;
said her friend, in a low voice. &#8220;You are already
a favourite, and in a fair way to become
the belle of the ball.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I try not to act too old, Kitty,&#8221; said Patty,
earnestly, &#8220;but truly everybody thinks I&#8217;m a
society lady. They don&#8217;t even look on me as a
débutante.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, dearie; have all the fun you can.
Enjoy the dancing, and don&#8217;t care what anybody
thinks.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Encouraged by Lady Hamilton&#8217;s approval,
Patty ceased to think about her demeanour and
proceeded to enjoy the conversation of those
about her.
</p>
<p>Lady Herenden was especially kind to her, and
singled out the young American for her special
favour and attention.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>THE EARL OF RUTHVEN</h3>
</div>

<p>After a time the men came from the dining-room
and rejoined the ladies.
</p>
<p>Patty was chatting with a group of
young women, and when she glanced around, it
was to see Lord Ruthven standing at her side.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was miles away from you at dinner,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;but now there is an opportunity, let us
begin our lessons in English at once.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do,&#8221; said Patty, smiling; &#8220;where shall be
our classroom?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll pre-empt this sofa,&#8221; said Lord Ruthven,
indicating, as he spoke, a gold-framed
Louis XIV. tête-à-tête. &#8220;We&#8217;ll pretend that it
is a real schoolroom, with four walls hung with
maps and charts&mdash;just such as you used to have
when you were a little girl.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty smiled at this reference to her far-away
school-days, but fell in with his mood.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and you must be the stern
schoolmaster, and I the stupid pupil who has
been kept in after school.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></p>
<p>But their merry game was interrupted by Lady
Herenden&#8217;s invitation to the ballroom.
</p>
<p>Escorted by Lord Ruthven, Patty followed the
others to the great hall where they were to
dance.
</p>
<p>It was a resplendent apartment, with balconies
and boxes, from which the spectators could look
down upon the dancers. A fine orchestra furnished
the music, and Patty, who loved to dance,
found her feet involuntarily keeping time to the
harmonious strains.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we have a try?&#8221; said Lord Ruthven,
and in a moment they were gliding over the
smooth floor.
</p>
<p>Patty already knew that English dancing is not
like the American steps, but she was so completely
mistress of the art, that she could adapt
herself instantly to any variation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t compliment your dancing,&#8221; said the
Earl, as the waltz was finished, &#8220;for you must
have been told so often how wonderfully well
you dance. But I must tell you what a pleasure
it is to dance with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty thought this a very pretty speech, and
graciously gave his lordship some other dances
for which he asked, and then, leaving her with
Lady Herenden, he excused himself and went
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
away. Then Patty was besieged with would-be
partners. Her dancing had called forth the
admiration of everybody, and the young men
crowded about, begging to see her dance-card.
</p>
<p>Only Mr. Merivale stood aloof. He was still
sulky, and he looked so like a cross schoolboy
that Patty took pity on him.
</p>
<p>She slightly nodded her head at him by way
of invitation, and he came slowly toward her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Which two do you want?&#8221; she said, demurely.
</p>
<p>Merivale&#8217;s face lighted up. &#8220;You are indeed
kind,&#8221; he said, in a low voice. &#8220;I will
take any you will give me. My card is blank
as yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So Patty arranged the dances, and the young
man went away looking much happier. The
evening was all too short. Patty whirled
through dance after dance, and between them
was restored to Lady Herenden or Lady Hamilton,
only to be claimed the next minute by another
partner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What a belle it is!&#8221; said Lady Herenden,
patting the girl&#8217;s shoulder affectionately. &#8220;You
have made a real sensation, Miss Fairfield.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m Cinderella, to-night,&#8221; she said, gaily.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Wait till to-morrow, and see all my popularity
vanish.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lady Herenden did not understand, but took it
as merry chaff and paid no heed.
</p>
<p>Then Lord Ruthven came for the last dance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an extra, Miss Fairfield,&#8221; he said;
&#8220;will you give it to me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty agreed, but as they walked away, his
Lordship said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You look really tired; would you not rather
sit on the terrace than dance?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am tired,&#8221; said Patty, honestly; &#8220;I think
it&#8217;s carrying this heavy train around. I&#8217;ve never
before danced in a long gown.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you shall rest. Let us sit on the terrace,
and I&#8217;ll send for an ice for you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lord Ruthven was very kind and courteous.
He found a delightful corner of the terrace unoccupied,
and he arranged two wicker easy-chairs,
where they might be just out of the way
of the promenaders. He asked a footman to
bring the ices, and then seated himself beside
Patty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it not beautiful,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the rose garden
in the moonlight? One can almost fancy the
roses opening beneath the moon&#8217;s light as in
daytime by the sun&#8217;s warm rays.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Patty, falling in with his fanciful
mood, &#8220;and I think, perhaps, at night, the
white roses and the pale yellow ones bloom.
Then at daybreak, the pink or blush roses open,
and at midday the deep red ones.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have the mind of a poet, Miss Fairfield.
Where do you get those graceful conceits?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Patty, carelessly;
&#8220;I think they are the result of this beautiful
moonlight night, and these picturesque surroundings.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I am sure that is true. You have a soul
that responds to all beauty in art or nature.
Let us take a short turn in the rose garden, and
get a view of this noble old house with the
moonlight full upon it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I want my ice cream,&#8221; objected Patty,
who still had her schoolgirl appetite.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll stay but a moment, and we&#8217;ll return to
find it awaiting us,&#8221; gently insisted Lord Ruthven,
and Patty amiably went down the terrace
steps and along the garden path with him.
</p>
<p>Near a clump of cedars, only a short distance
away, they turned to look at the beautiful old
house. Herenden Hall was always a splendid
picture, but especially at night, backgrounded
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
by a gray sky full of racing clouds, and touched
at every gable by the silver moonlight, it was
enchanting.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Patty, drawing a sigh, &#8220;it is the
most wonderful effect I ever saw. See that
great, quiet roof sloping darkly away, and beneath,
the gay lights of the terrace, and the
laughter of happy people.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a beautiful picture,&#8221; said Lord Ruthven,
looking steadily at Patty, &#8220;but not so beautiful
as another one I see. A lovely face framed
in soft, shining curls, against a background of
dark cedar trees.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His tone, even more than his words, alarmed
Patty. She was not used to such speeches as this,
and she said, gravely: &#8220;Take me back to the
house, please, Lord Ruthven.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not just yet,&#8221; pleaded the nobleman.
&#8220;Dear Miss Fairfield, listen to me a moment.
Let me tell you something. Let me justify myself.
I oughtn&#8217;t to talk to you like this, I
know&mdash;but the fact is&mdash;oh, the fact is you&#8217;ve
completely bowled me over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; said Patty, not at all comprehending
his meaning.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I&#8217;m done for&mdash;and at first sight! And
by an American! But it&#8217;s a fact. I adore you,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
Miss Fairfield&mdash;I&#8217;m so desperately in love with
you that I can&#8217;t down it. Oh, I know I oughtn&#8217;t
to be talking to you like this. I ought to see
your father, and all that. And I will, as soon
as I can, but&mdash;oh, I say, Patty, tell me you
like me a little!&#8221;
</p>
<p>It suddenly dawned on Patty that she was having
a proposal! And from an English Earl!
And all on account of her grown-up gown! The
absurdity of it impressed her far more than
the romantic side of it, and though a little
frightened, she couldn&#8217;t help smiling at the
Earl&#8217;s tragic tones.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense, Lord Ruthven,&#8221; she said, though
her cheeks were pink; &#8220;don&#8217;t talk like that.
Please cut me that lovely cluster of roses, and
then take me back to Lady Hamilton.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Earl drew a penknife from his pocket,
and cut the flowers she asked for. Then he
stood, trimming off the thorns, and looking down
at her.
</p>
<p>Patty had never looked so winsome. Her garb
made her seem a grown woman, and yet the
situation alarmed her, and her perplexed face
was that of a troubled child.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me,&#8221; he repeated, &#8220;that you like me a
little.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I like you a little,&#8221; returned Patty,
in a matter-of-fact voice. &#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t I?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s something,&#8221; said the Earl, in a tone
of satisfaction, &#8220;and now will you accept these
flowers as a gift from me? As, for the moment,
I&#8217;ve nothing else to offer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty took the flowers in both hands, but Lord
Ruthven still held them, too, saying: &#8220;And will
you let them mean&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; cried Patty, &#8220;they don&#8217;t mean anything&mdash;not
anything at all!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lord Ruthven clasped Patty&#8217;s two hands, roses
and all, in his own.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They do,&#8221; he said quietly; &#8220;they mean I
love you. Do you understand?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He looked straight into the troubled, beseeching
eyes that met his own.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Please let me go, Lord Ruthven&mdash;<i>please!</i>&#8221;
said Patty, her hands trembling in his own.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You may go, if you will first call me by some
less formal name. Patty, dearest, say Sylvester&mdash;just
once!&#8221;
</p>
<p>This desperate request was too much for
Patty&#8217;s sense of humour.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t I say it twice?&#8221; she said in a
low tone, but her voice was shaking with
laughter.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You little witch!&#8221; exclaimed the Earl, and
his clasp tightened on her hands. &#8220;Now you
shan&#8217;t go until you <i>have</i> said it twice!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sylvester&mdash;Sylvester&mdash;there!&#8221; said Patty,
her eyes twinkling with fun, and her lips on the
verge of laughter. Then, gently disengaging
her hands from his, she gathered up her long
white train, and prepared to run away.
</p>
<p>The Earl laid a detaining hand on her arm.
&#8220;Miss Fairfield,&#8221; he said, &#8220;Patty, I won&#8217;t keep
you now, but to-morrow you&#8217;ll give me an opportunity,
won&#8217;t you? to tell you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait till to-morrow, my lord,&#8221; said Patty,
really laughing now. &#8220;You will probably have
changed your mind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How little you know me!&#8221; he cried, reproachfully,
and then they had reached the terrace,
and joined the others.
</p>
<p>Soon after the guests all retired to their own
rooms, and the moonlight on Herenden Hall
saw no more the gay scene on the terrace.
</p>
<p>Patty, passing through her own room, discovered
that her two trunks had arrived and had
been unpacked. She went straight on and tapped
at Lady Hamilton&#8217;s door. &#8220;Get me out of this
gown, please, Marie; I&#8217;ve had quite enough
of being a grown-up young woman!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Patty?&#8221; said Lady Kitty,
looking round. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you have a good time
this evening?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The time of my life!&#8221; declared Patty, dropping
into her own graphic speech, as she emerged
from the heap of lace and silk. &#8220;I&#8217;ll see you
later, Kitty,&#8221; and without further word she returned
to her own room.
</p>
<p>And later, when Marie had been dismissed,
Patty crept back to Lady Hamilton, a very different
Patty, indeed. Her hair fell in two long
braids, with curly tails; a dainty dressing-gown
enveloped her slight figure; and on her bare feet
were heelless satin slippers. She found Lady
Kitty in an armchair before the wood fire, awaiting
her.
</p>
<p>Patty threw a big, fat sofa pillow at her
friend&#8217;s feet, and settled herself cosily upon
it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, girlie,&#8221; said Lady Hamilton, &#8220;come to
the story at once. What happened to you as a
grown-up?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What usually happens to grown-ups, I suppose,&#8221;
said Patty, demurely; &#8220;the Earl of Ruthven
proposed to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; cried Lady Hamilton, starting up,
and quite upsetting Patty from her cushion.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he did,&#8221; went on Patty, placidly; &#8220;shall
I accept him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty, you naughty child, tell me all about
it at once! Oh, what shall I say to your father
and mother?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty grinned. &#8220;Yes, it was all your fault,
Kitty. If I hadn&#8217;t worn your gown, he would
never have dreamed of such a thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Patty, it <i>can&#8217;t</i> be true. You must have
misunderstood him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not I. It&#8217;s my first proposal, to be sure;
but I know what a man means when he says he
loves me and begs me to call him by his first
name. And I did&mdash;twice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty went off in shrieks of laughter at
the remembrance of it, and she rocked back
and forth on her cushion in paroxysms of
mirth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty, behave yourself, and tell me the truth.
I&#8217;ve a mind to shake you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I <i>am</i> shaking,&#8221; said Patty, trying to control
her voice. &#8220;And I <i>am</i> telling you the
truth. His first name is Sylvester. Lovely
name!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did this occur?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In the rose garden. Oh, right near the terrace.
Not a dozen yards away from you all.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
I&#8217;m sure if you&#8217;d been listening, you could have
heard me say, &#8216;Sylvester&mdash;<i>Sylvester!</i>&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again Patty went off in uncontrollable merriment
at this recollection, and Lady Kitty had to
laugh too.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you tell him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I told him to wait till to-morrow, and he&#8217;d
probably change his mind. And I see my trunks
have come, so he surely will. You see he proposed
to that long-tailed gown and jewelled
tiara I had on&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t a tiara.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it looked something like one. I&#8217;m sure
he thought it was. He doubtless wants a dignified,
stately Lady Ruthven, and he thought
I was <i>it</i>. Oh, Kitty! if you could have heard
him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s nice of you, to take him
that way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, I won&#8217;t. But I&#8217;m not going to
take him at all. Why, Kitty, when he sees me
to-morrow in my own little pink muslin, he
won&#8217;t know me, let alone remembering what he
said to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty, you&#8217;re incorrigible. I don&#8217;t know
what to say to you. But I hope your parents
won&#8217;t blame me for this.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Of course they won&#8217;t, Kitsie. You see it
was an accident. A sort of case of mistaken
identity. I don&#8217;t mind it so much now that it&#8217;s
over, but I was scared stiff at the time. Only
it was all so funny that it swallowed up my
scare. Now I&#8217;ll tell you the whole story.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So Patty told every word that the Earl had
said to her during the evening, in the ballroom
and on the terrace. And Lady Hamilton listened
attentively.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You were not a bit to blame, dear,&#8221; she
said, kindly, when the tale was finished. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t think you even flirted with him. But it&#8217;s
truly extraordinary that he should speak so
soon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was on the spur of the moment,&#8221; declared
Patty, with conviction. &#8220;You know, moonlight
and roses and a summer evening have a romantic
influence on some natures.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you know of a romantic influence,
you baby. Hop along to bed, now, and
get up in the morning your own sweet,
natural self&mdash;without a thought of Earls or
moonlight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will so,&#8221; said Patty; &#8220;I didn&#8217;t like it a bit,
except that it was all so funny. Won&#8217;t Nan
howl?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She may, but I&#8217;m afraid your father will be
annoyed. You know you&#8217;re in my care,
Patty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you worry. I&#8217;ll tell Daddy all about
it. And I rather guess it will make him laugh.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>AN IMPORTANT DOCUMENT</h3>
</div>

<p>It was the custom at Herenden Hall to serve
morning tea to the guests in their rooms.
</p>
<p>When Patty&#8217;s tray was brought, she asked
to have it taken into Lady Hamilton&#8217;s room,
and the two friends chatted cosily over their
toast and teacups.
</p>
<p>Lady Kitty, with a dainty dressing-jacket round
her shoulders, was still nestled among her pillows,
while Patty, in a blue kimono, curled up,
Turk-fashion on the foot of the bed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a gorgeous day,&#8221; observed Patty, stirring
her tea, which she was trying to sip, though she
hated it. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be glad to explore that lovely
rose garden without horrid old moonlit Earls.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a wonderfully fine place, Patty; you really
must go over the estate. I&#8217;ll show you round
myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Patty, airily, &#8220;but I believe
I have an engagement. Mr. Snowden, or
Snowed on, or Snowed under, or whatever his
name is, kindly offered to do that same.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and he&#8217;ll kindly withdraw his offer when
he sees you in your own rightful raiment. I&#8217;ve
a notion to put you in a pinafore, and give
you a Teddy Bear to carry. There&#8217;s no keeping
you down any other way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t be alarmed. I&#8217;ve no designs on the
young men. I like the boys better, anyhow.
That Jack Merivale is a chummy kind of a
youth. That&#8217;s the sort I like. Rest assured I
won&#8217;t trouble that wretched Earl. I won&#8217;t even
speak to him, and I&#8217;ll make over to you whatever
interest he may deign to show in me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As one Humpty Dumpty said, &#8216;I&#8217;d rather see
that on paper.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you shall,&#8221; said Patty, and setting down
her unfinished tea, she flew to the writing
table.
</p>
<p>Perching herself on the corner of the desk
chair, she laid out a sheet of Lady Herenden&#8217;s
crested note paper, and took up a pen. &#8220;Shall
I write the agreement as I please?&#8221; she said,
&#8220;or will you dictate it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll dictate,&#8221; said Lady Kitty, smiling lazily
at the foolery. But as she paused between sentences,
Patty put in parentheses of her own, and
when finished the remarkable document read
thus:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;I, the undersigned, being of (fairly) sound
mind, do hereby of my own free will (coerced by
one Lady Hamilton) relinquish all interest or
concern in the (illustrious) personage known as
Sylvester, Earl of Ruthven (but I do think he
has a lovely name), and should he show any interest
in me, personally, I promise (gladly) to
refer him to (the aforesaid) Lady Hamilton
(though what she wants of him, I don&#8217;t
know!), and I hereby solemnly promise and
agree, not to seek or accept any further acquaintance
or friendship with the (Belted)
gentleman above referred to.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Furthermore, I (being still of sound mind,
but it&#8217;s tottering) promise not to talk or converse
with the (Sylvester! <i>Sylvester!</i>) Earl of
Ruthven, beyond the ordinary civilities of the
day (whatever that may mean!), never to
smile at him voluntarily (I can&#8217;t help laughing
at him), and <i>never</i> to wave my eyelashes at him
across the table. (<i>Why</i> does she think I&#8217;d do
that?)
</p>
<p style='text-align:right; margin-right:20%'>&#8220;Witness my hand and seal,</p>
<p style='text-align:right;'>&#8220;PATRICIA FAIRFIELD.&#8221;</p>

</div>
<p>(&#8220;Lady Patricia would sound great! Wouldn&#8217;t it?&#8221;)
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There, Kitty Cat,&#8221; said Patty, tossing the
paper to Lady Hamilton, &#8220;there&#8217;s your agreement,
and now, my dreams of glory over, I&#8217;ll
go and &#8216;bind my hair and lace my bodice blue.&#8217;
I always wondered how people bind their hair.
Do you suppose they use skirt braid?&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Lady Kitty was shaking with laughter
over Patty&#8217;s foolish &#8220;document&#8221; and offered
no reply.
</p>
<p>An hour or so later, Patty presented herself
for inspection.
</p>
<p>She wore a pale blue dimity, whose round, full
blouse was belted with a soft ribbon. The skirt,
with its three frills edged with tiny lace, came
just to her instep, and disclosed dainty, patent-leather
oxfords.
</p>
<p>Her golden braids, crossed and recrossed low
at the back of her head, were almost covered
by a big butterfly bow of wide white ribbon.
In fact, she was perfectly garbed for an American
girl of eighteen, and the costume was more
becoming to her pretty, young face than the
trained gown of the night before.
</p>
<p>Lady Hamilton was still at her dressing table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel quite at ease about you now,&#8221; she said,
looking up. &#8220;Nobody will propose to you in
that rig. They&#8217;ll be more likely to buy you a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
doll. I&#8217;m not nearly ready yet, but don&#8217;t wait.
Run along downstairs, you&#8217;ll find plenty of
people about.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Slowly Patty descended the great staircase,
looking at the pictures and hanging rugs as she
passed them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;For mercy&#8217;s sake, who is that?&#8221; was Lady
Herenden&#8217;s mental exclamation as the girl
neared the lower floor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-morning, Lady Herenden,&#8221; cried
Patty, gaily, as she approached her hostess.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t look so surprised to see me, and I&#8217;ll
tell you all about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s Miss Fairfield!&#8221; exclaimed the
elder lady, making room for Patty on the sofa
beside her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and I really owe you an explanation.
You see, my boxes didn&#8217;t come last night, and
I had to wear one of Lady Hamilton&#8217;s gowns
at dinner. I couldn&#8217;t tell you so, before all the
guests, and so you didn&#8217;t know me this morning
in my own frock.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s astonishing what a difference it makes!
You look years younger.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am. I&#8217;m not quite eighteen yet, and I wish
you&#8217;d call me Patty, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will, indeed,&#8221; said Lady Herenden, answering
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
the pretty smile that accompanied the
request. &#8220;I knew Kitty Hamilton said you
weren&#8217;t out yet, and so, when I saw you last
night, I just couldn&#8217;t understand it. But I do
now. Have you breakfasted, dearie?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, thank you. And now, I want to go out
and see the flowers, and the dogs. May I?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed. Run around as you like.
You&#8217;ll find people on the terrace and lawn,
though there are no girls here as young as yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t matter. I like people of all
ages. I&#8217;ve friends from four to forty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not surprised. You&#8217;re a friendly little
thing. Be sure to go through the rose orchard;
it&#8217;s back of the rose garden, and you&#8217;ll
love it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hatless, Patty ran out into the sunshine, and,
strolling through the rose garden, soon forgot
all else in her delight at the marvellous array of
blossoms.
</p>
<p>As she turned a corner of a path, she came
upon two men talking together. They were
Lord Ruthven and Lord Herenden&#8217;s head gardener.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; his lordship was saying, &#8220;you&#8217;ve done
a good thing, Parker, in getting that hybrid.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
And this next bush is a fine one, too. Is it a
Baroness Rothschild?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Patty, carelessly joining in the conversation,
&#8220;it&#8217;s a Catherine Mermet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So it is, Miss,&#8221; said the gardener, turning
politely toward her, but Lord Ruthven, after
a slight glance, paid no attention to the
girl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure, Parker?&#8221; he said. &#8220;The
Mermets are usually pinker.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t know me! What larks!&#8221;
thought Patty, gleefully. &#8220;I&#8217;ll try again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is the rose orchard, Parker?&#8221; she
asked, turning her full face toward the gardener,
and leaving only the big white bow to greet the
Earl.
</p>
<p>Something in her voice startled Lord Ruthven,
and he wheeled quickly about. &#8220;It is&mdash;it can&#8217;t
be&mdash;Miss Fairfield?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-morning, my lord,&#8221; said Patty, with
cool politeness. &#8220;This, of course,&#8221; she thought
to herself, &#8220;is the civility of the day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will show you the rose orchard,&#8221; went on
the Earl. &#8220;Come with me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thank you,&#8221; said Patty, turning again
to the gardener. She was absurdly placed, and
she felt a little embarrassed. But, on the other
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
hand, she had pledged her word, and a silly performance
it was! But she would keep it, at
least until Lady Hamilton released her from her
promise. Patty&#8217;s ideas of honour were, perhaps,
a little strained, but she took the promise of that
burlesque document as seriously as if it had been
of national importance. And now she was in a
dilemma. To refuse to walk with the Earl was
so rude, and yet to talk with him was to break
her pledged word.
</p>
<p>The gardener went on about his work, and the
other two stood silent. For the first time in
her life, Patty had a really difficult situation to
cope with. If she could have laughed and talked
naturally, it would have been easy to explain
matters. But that absurd paper sealed her lips.
Oh, why had she been so foolish?
</p>
<p>She did not look at the Earl, but he gazed
fixedly at her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Why are
you so changed from last evening?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty thought hard. She was allowed the
&#8220;civilities of the day,&#8221; so she must depend on
those.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it a charming morning?&#8221; she said,
without, however, turning toward the man at
her side.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It is indeed. But why are you such an
enigma? Are all Americans so puzzling?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And isn&#8217;t the rose garden wonderful?&#8221; went
on Patty, still looking off in the distance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wonderful, of course. Please look at me.
I believe, after all, you&#8217;re Miss Fairfield&#8217;s
younger sister! Ah, I have guessed you at
last!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty still looked straight ahead, but an irrepressible
smile dimpled the corners of her
mouth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think it will rain?&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By Jove, I won&#8217;t stand this!&#8221; cried the
Earl, impetuously. &#8220;I know you are yourself&mdash;the
Miss Fairfield I talked with last night&mdash;but
why you&#8217;re masquerading as a schoolgirl,
I don&#8217;t know!&#8221;
</p>
<p>At this Patty could restrain her mirth no
longer, and her pretty laughter seemed to appease
the Earl&#8217;s irritation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I not fit to be looked at, or spoken to?&#8221;
he said, more gently; &#8220;and if not, you must at
least tell me why.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you why,&#8221; said Patty, stifling her
laughter, but still gazing at the far-away hills.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t you? Have you promised not
to?&#8221; The Earl meant this as a jest, little thinking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
it was the truth, but Patty, now nearly choking
with merriment, said demurely, &#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense! I&#8217;m not going to eat you! Look
at me, child.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t,&#8221; repeated Patty, in a small voice, and
holding her wilful, golden head very straight,
as she stared firmly ahead.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whom did you promise?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have no right to ask.&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;That,&#8221; said
Patty to herself, &#8220;is an ordinary <i>incivility</i>, but I
can&#8217;t help it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a right to ask! And I don&#8217;t care
whether I have or not. You&#8217;re a mischief, and
I won&#8217;t stand any more of your chaff. Who
made you promise not to speak to me, or look
at me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Earl, quietly, but with a decided air,
moved around until he faced Patty, and the
laughing blue eyes were so full of fun that he
laughed too.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You ridiculous baby!&#8221; he cried; &#8220;what are
you, anyway? One night, a charming young
woman, the next day, a naughty child.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m <i>not</i> naughty! Nobody made me promise.
I did it of my own free will.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But whom did you promise?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lady Hamilton,&#8221; said Patty, remembering
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
all at once that the matter was to be referred to
her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oho! Well, now, see here. You just break
that promise, as quick as you can, and I&#8217;ll make
it square with Lady Hamilton.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you?&#8221; said Patty, drawing a long sigh
of relief. &#8220;And will you blot out last evening,
and pretend it never was, and begin our acquaintance
from now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; said the Earl, looking at her, curiously,
&#8220;if you will tell me why you seem to
have a dual personality.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then Patty explained her appearance at dinner
in Lady Hamilton&#8217;s gown, and to her pleased
surprise, the Earl laughed long and loudly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Best joke ever!&#8221; he declared; &#8220;a baby like
you giving an imitation of the &#8216;belle of the
ball&#8217;!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not so infantile,&#8221; said Patty, pouting a
little, for the Earl now treated her as if she
were about twelve.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are!&#8221; he declared. &#8220;You ought to be
in the schoolroom eating bread and jam.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like the bread and jam well enough, for
I&#8217;m getting hungrier every minute.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s an hour yet to luncheon time; come
along and I&#8217;ll show you the rose orchard. It
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
may make you forget your gnawing pangs of
hunger.&#8221;
</p>
<p>On pleasant terms, then, they went through the
gate in the high hedge that surrounded the enclosure.
The rose orchard was unique. It had
originally been a fruit orchard, and as most
of the trees were dead, and many of them fallen,
roses had been trained over their trunks and
branches. The gorgeous masses of bloom covered
the old gnarled wood, and the climbing
roses twined lovingly around branches and
boughs. Here and there were rustic seats and
arbours; and there were many bird-houses,
whose tiny occupants were exceedingly tame and
sociable. Several other guests were walking
about, and Patty and the Earl joined a group
which included their host and hostess.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you like it?&#8221; said Lady Herenden,
drawing Patty&#8217;s arm through her own.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the most beautiful place since the Garden
of Eden,&#8221; said Patty, so enthusiastically
that everybody laughed.
</p>
<p>Then Mr. Snowden sauntered up, and reminded
Patty of her promise to go walking
with him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t seen the deer park yet,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;nor the carp pond; though I believe the carp
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
are merely tradition. Still, the pond is
there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Run along, child!&#8221; said Lady Herenden.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll just about have time for a pleasant
stroll before luncheon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty was greatly relieved when Mr. Snowden
made no reference to her age or her costume.
He treated her politely and chatted gaily as he
led her around to see all the picturesque bits of
woodland and meadow. The magnificent old
place showed its age, for it had not been unduly
renovated, though everything was in good
order.
</p>
<p>They went into the old church, which was on
the estate, they visited the farmhouses and
stables, and Patty found Mr. Snowden a kind
and entertaining guide.

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>A MOMENTOUS INTERVIEW</h3>
</div>

<p>The rest of their stay at Herenden Hall
passed off delightfully. Patty fitted into
her own niche, and everybody liked the
natural, unaffected young girl.
</p>
<p>She and Jack Merivale became good chums,
and went fishing together, and rowing on the
pond like old cronies.
</p>
<p>It was Patty&#8217;s nature to make friends quickly,
and during her stay in Kent, she had a royal
good time. Lord Ruthven talked over the matter
with Lady Hamilton, and as he chose to consider
it all a great joke on himself, she also took
his view of it. As for Patty, she was so engrossed
with other people that she nearly forgot
all about the moonlight episode.
</p>
<p>Only sometimes, when she chanced to catch
sight of Lord Ruthven, she would say to herself,
&#8220;Sylvester, <i>Sylvester!</i>&#8221; and then turn
away to hide her laughter.
</p>
<p>They stayed over until Tuesday, and then took
the noon train back to London, Lady Herenden
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
expressing an earnest wish that Patty would
visit her again. Lady Kitty and Patty reached
the Savoy duly, and Mr. Fairfield invited the
returned travellers to dinner in the great Restaurant.
This was a treat in itself, and Patty
gleefully ran up to her room to dress for
dinner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lend me one of your gowns to wear,
Kitty?&#8221; she said, roguishly, looking in at her
friend&#8217;s door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go away, you bad child. You&#8217;re not in my
care, now. I shall confess all to your father to-night
at dinner, and then I&#8217;ve done with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve chosen a wise time,&#8221; said Patty,
sagely. &#8220;Father&#8217;s always especially good-natured
at dinner.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us hope he will be,&#8221; said Lady Hamilton,
who was really a little anxious about it all.
But she need not have been, for when the story
was told, both Mr. and Mrs. Fairfield looked
upon it as a huge joke.
</p>
<p>Nan, especially, was almost convulsed with
laughter at the account Patty gave of the moonlight
scene, and her tragic repetition in a stage
whisper of &#8220;Sylvester, <i>Sylvester!</i>&#8221; was truly
funny of itself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It couldn&#8217;t be helped,&#8221; said Mr. Fairfield,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
&#8220;and it was in no way your fault, Lady Hamilton.
It would have been a pity to shut Patty
in her room on such a gala occasion, and no
one could foresee that she was going to throw
herself at the Earl&#8217;s head!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Father!&#8221; exclaimed Patty, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t do any
such thing! He threw himself at my feet, if
you please.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s all right, chickabiddy, but don&#8217;t
let it happen again. At least, not for many
years, yet. I suppose some time, in the far future,
I shall be asked to be a father-in-law to
a Duke or a Count, but let&#8217;s put it off as long as
possible.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then Nan will be Dowager Duchess,&#8221; cried
irrepressible Patty, &#8220;won&#8217;t that be fun!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can do it,&#8221; said Nan, with an air of self-satisfaction
that made them all laugh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you exonerate me,&#8221; said Lady
Hamilton, with a sigh of relief. &#8220;And since I
let Patty appear too old, I&#8217;m going to average
matters in this way. Next week is the child&#8217;s
birthday, and I want to give her a children&#8217;s
party, if I may. You and your husband may
come, Mrs. Fairfield, if you&#8217;ll both dress as
children of tender years.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll do it,&#8221; cried Mr. Fairfield. &#8220;This is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
an inspiration of yours, Lady Hamilton, and
will, as you say, quite even things up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then plans were speedily made for the children&#8217;s
party. It was only a week to Patty&#8217;s
birthday, but Lady Kitty said that was long
enough ahead to send invitations to an afternoon
affair.
</p>
<p>For the party was to be held from three to
six, and each guest was asked to dress as a small
child. Patty put considerable thought on her
own costume, for she said her eighteenth birthday
was an important occasion, and she must
do it honour.
</p>
<p>She finally decided on a quaint little Kate
Greenaway dress, and big-brimmed hat of dark
green velvet with white feathers tumbling over
its brim. The frock was ankle length and
short-waisted and she wore old-fashioned little
slippers, with crossed ribbons, and black lace
mitts. A shirred silk workbag hung at her
side, and she carried a tiny parasol.
</p>
<p>A few days before the party, Patty had an
inspiration. It came to her suddenly, as most
inspirations do, and it was so startling that it
almost took her breath away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I <i>can&#8217;t</i> do it,&#8221; she said to herself, one minute;
and &#8220;I <i>will</i> do it,&#8221; she said to herself the next.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></p>
<p>Not daring to think long about it lest she
lose her determination, she started that very
afternoon on her surprising errand.
</p>
<p>She had the carriage to herself, for she had
been to tea with a friend, and on her way home
she asked the coachman to stop at a house in
Carlton Terrace.
</p>
<p>Reaching the house, Patty sent her card in by
the footman, and awaited results with a beating
heart.
</p>
<p>The footman returned to the carriage door,
saying, Sir Otho Markleham would be pleased
to see Miss Fairfield, and resolutely crushing
down her timidity, Patty went in.
</p>
<p>She was ushered into a large and formal drawing-room,
and waited there a few moments
alone.
</p>
<p>She wished she had been asked into a library,
or some more cosy room, for the stiff hangings,
and massive furniture were oppressive. But she
had no time for further thought, for Sir Otho
entered the room.
</p>
<p>He bowed with exceeding courtesy, but with
a surprised air, which was indeed only natural.
</p>
<p>Frightened almost out of her wits, Patty extended
her hand, and though she tried to conquer
her embarrassment, her voice trembled, as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
she said: &#8220;How do you do, Sir Otho? I&#8217;ve
come to see you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She tried to speak jauntily, but there was a
queer little break in her voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So I perceive,&#8221; said Sir Otho, coldly. &#8220;May
I ask why I have this honour?&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was too much for Patty. Her nerves
were strained almost to the breaking point, and
when Sir Otho spoke so repellently, she realised
how foolish her little plan had been, and how
hopeless was her dream of reconciling this
dreadful old man and his daughter. Partly,
then, because of her overwrought nerves, and
partly because of the downfall of her cherished
hopes, Patty burst into tears.
</p>
<p>She rarely cried, almost never, unless at some
injustice or undeserved unkindness. But when
she did cry, it was done as she did everything
else, with a whole-souled enthusiasm.
</p>
<p>Utterly unable to control herself, for a few
moments she sobbed, and shook in paroxysms
of emotion.
</p>
<p>The old gentleman fairly danced around.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless my soul!&#8221; he exclaimed; &#8220;what is the
matter? What does this mean? Did you come
into my house for the purpose of having a fit
of hysterics?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span></p>
<p>Now Patty wasn&#8217;t a bit hysterical; it was
merely a sudden blow of disappointment, and
she would have been over it in a moment, but
that Sir Otho made matters worse by storming
at her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop it, do you hear? I won&#8217;t have such
goings on in my house! You are a madwoman!&#8221;
</p>
<p>As Patty&#8217;s sobs grew quieter, and she sat softly
weeping into an already soaked handkerchief,
her host&#8217;s mood seemed to change also.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When I consented to see Miss Patricia Fairfield,&#8221;
he said, quoting her name as it appeared
on the card she had sent in, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know I
was to be subjected to this extraordinary treatment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I d-didn&#8217;t know it e-either,&#8221; said Patty,
wiping her eyes, and trying to smile. Then,
as she saw Sir Otho&#8217;s hard old face beginning
to soften a little, she smiled at him through her
tears.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There, there, my dear, don&#8217;t cry,&#8221; he said,
with a clumsy imitation of gentleness. &#8220;Shall
I ring for a maid? Will you have some sal
volatile?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Patty, trying hard to check her
sobs; &#8220;no, I will go away.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But what&#8217;s it all about?&#8221; said the bewildered
old man. &#8220;What made you cry?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You did,&#8221; said Patty, with such suddenness
that he nearly fell over.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I? Bless my soul! What did I do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You were so c-cross,&#8221; said Patty, weeping
afresh at the remembrance of his cold looks.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, never mind, child, I won&#8217;t be cross
again. Tell me all about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Surely Sir Otho was melting! Patty sagaciously
believed he was touched by her tears, so
made no desperate effort to stop them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I c-can&#8217;t tell you now. You&#8217;re not in a k-kind
m-mood.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I am; try to tell me, my dear child.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty thought she had never known any one
who could turn from anger to kindness so suddenly,
but she resolved to strike while the iron
was hot.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about K-Kitty,&#8221; she said, still sobbing,
but peeping out from behind her handkerchief
to see how he took this broadside.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I supposed so,&#8221; he said, with a sigh. &#8220;Well,
what about her?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s your daughter, you know,&#8221; went on
Patty, growing more daring, as she slyly
watched the old gentleman&#8217;s expression.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Is she, indeed? I&#8217;d forgotten the fact.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This, though in a sarcastic tone, was better
than his usual disavowal of the relationship.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And did you stop in here, and treat me to
this absurd scene, just to inform me concerning
my family tree?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;N-no,&#8221; said Patty, resorting to tears again.
&#8220;I stopped in, to&mdash;to ask you s-something.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, out with it! Are you afraid of
me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>This nettled Patty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said, starting to her feet. Her
tears had stopped now, and her eyes were blazing.
&#8220;No! I am not afraid of you! I&#8217;m sorry
I broke down. I was foolishly nervous. But
I&#8217;m over it now. I came in here, Sir Otho Markleham,
to ask you to make peace with your
daughter, and to propose to you a pleasant way
to do so. But you have been so cross and
ugly, so sarcastic and cruel, that I see the utter
hopelessness of trying to reconcile you two. I
was foolish even to think of it! Lady Kitty is
gentle and sweet in many ways, but she has inherited
your obstinate, stubborn&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pigheaded,&#8221; suggested Sir Otho, politely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes! Pigheaded disposition, and though, as
the older, you ought to make the advance,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
you&#8217;ll never do it&mdash;and she never will&mdash;and&mdash;so&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty broke down again, this time from sheer
sadness of heart at the irrevocable state of
things.
</p>
<p>Her face buried in her handkerchief, to her
great surprise she felt a kindly touch on her
shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t condemn me too soon, little one; and
don&#8217;t condemn me unheard. Suppose I tell you
that some of my ideas have undergone a change
since Miss Yankee Doodle has taken it upon
herself to scold me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Patty, rendered almost breathless
with amazement at the kind tone and the gentle
touch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But suppose it&#8217;s very hard for an old man
like me to uproot some feelings that have
grown and strengthened with the passing
years.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But if they&#8217;re bad and unworthy feelings,
you <i>want</i> to uproot them!&#8221; cried Patty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Sir Otho, &#8220;I do. And though
my irascible and taciturn nature won&#8217;t let me admit
this to any one else, I&#8217;ll confess to you, Miss
Yankee Doodle, I do want to pull them up, root
and branch.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></p>
<p>Sir Otho looked so brave and manly as he
made this confession, which was truly difficult
for him, that Patty grasped his hand in both
hers, and cried: &#8220;Oh, what a <i>splendid</i> man
you are! I&#8217;ll <i>never</i> be afraid of you again!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You <i>weren&#8217;t</i> afraid of me, child. That&#8217;s
why your words had weight with me. You fearlessly
told me just what I was, and I had the
grace to be ashamed of myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind that now,&#8221; said Patty, eagerly.
&#8220;Do you want to be friends again with Kitty?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;More than anything on earth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, let me manage it; and do it the
way I want you to, will you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty&#8217;s voice and smile were very wheedlesome,
and Sir Otho smiled in response, as he
said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve surely earned the right to manage it.
How shall it be done? Will Kitty meet me halfway?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think she will,&#8221; said Patty, slowly. &#8220;But
she&#8217;s not very tractable, you know. Indeed, Sir
Otho, she&#8217;s such a contrary-minded person, that
if she knew you wanted to be kind to her, she&#8217;d
likely run away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Patricia,&#8221; said Sir Otho, gravely, &#8220;you
can&#8217;t tell me anything about my daughter
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
Catharine that I don&#8217;t already know. And she
is, indeed, contrary-minded, on occasion. As
you so justly observed, she inherits my obstinate
and cross-grained disposition.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet she&#8217;s so lovely to look at,&#8221; sighed
Patty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, well, she didn&#8217;t get her good looks from
me, I&#8217;ll admit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think she did,&#8221; said Patty, looking critically
at the fine old face, with a thoughtful gaze
that was very amusing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, are you going to detail to me the
plan of this rather difficult campaign?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I am. And I hope you&#8217;ll see it as
I do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I don&#8217;t, I have little doubt but you can
change my views. Will you have time to drink
a cup of tea with me? We can plan so much
more cosily over the teacups.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I will,&#8221; said Patty, consulting her
watch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then let us have it served in the library, and
not in this depressing room, which you must associate
with stormy outbursts of woe.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty laughed, and followed the stately old
gentleman into the library, where tea was soon
served.
</p>

<p>&#8220;One lump?&#8221; said Patty, holding the sugar-tongs
poised over a teacup, while she put
her head on one side and smiled at her
host.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Two, please. It&#8217;s delightful to have some
one make my tea for me, and you do it very
prettily.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, alas!&#8221; said Patty, in mock despair,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll soon be supplanted here, by that &#8216;obstinate,
cross-grained&#8217; Lady Kitty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why are you so sure she&#8217;ll come back here
to live?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just give her the chance, and see,&#8221; said
Patty, wagging her head sagaciously, as she
poured her own tea.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How <i>much</i> pleasanter this is than squabbling,&#8221;
she observed, glancing happily at her
host.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, or crying,&#8221; said he, a bit teasingly, and
Patty blushed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s past history,&#8221; she said; &#8220;and <i>now</i>
I&#8217;ll tell you my plan.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The details of the plan kept them both talking
for some time, and then Patty had to
hurry away to reach home at her appointed
hour.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, I won&#8217;t see you again until then,&#8221; she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
said, as they parted at the door. &#8220;But I know
you won&#8217;t fail me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not I!&#8221; said Sir Otho, and with his hand
on his heart, he made a profound bow, and
Patty drove homeward in the happiest mood
she had known for many a day.

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>THE BIRTHDAY PARTY</h3>
</div>

<p>Patty&#8217;s birthday party was a great success.
</p>
<p>As a rule, young people love a &#8220;dress-up&#8221;
party, and the guests all entered into the
spirit of the thing.
</p>
<p>Lady Hamilton was in her element.
</p>
<p>For the occasion, she had engaged a large
salon, and aside from the pretty floral decorations,
there were dolls and Teddy Bears and
rocking horses, and all sorts of children&#8217;s toys
and games. On the walls hung bright-colored
prints, intended for nursery use, and little, low
chairs and ottomans stood about.
</p>
<p>Of course, Lady Hamilton, as hostess, did not
dress like a child, but wore one of her own
lovely, trailing white house-gowns.
</p>
<p>When the guests arrived they were shown to
dressing-rooms, where white-capped nurses
awaited them, and assisted them to lay aside
their wraps.
</p>
<p>Then led to the salon by these same nurses,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
the guests were presented to Lady Hamilton
and Patty. Such shouts of laughter as arose
at these presentations! The young people,
dressed as tiny children, came in with a shy air
(not always entirely assumed), and made funny
little, bobbing curtseys. Some, finger in mouth,
could find nothing to say; others of more fertile
brain, babbled childishly, or lisped in baby-talk.
</p>
<p>Before many had arrived, Patty and Lady
Kitty were in such roars of laughter they could
scarcely welcome the rest.
</p>
<p>Tom Meredith was a dear. Though a boy
nearly six feet tall, he had a round, cherubic
face, and soft, curly hair. He wore a white
dress of simple &#8220;Mother Hubbard&#8221; cut, the
fulness hanging from a yoke, and ending just
below his knees, in lace-edged frills. White
stockings, and white kid pumps adorned his
feet, and his short curls were tied at one side
with an immense white bow. He was such a
smiling, good-natured chap, and looked so girlish
and sweet in his white frock, that Patty at
once called him Baby Belle, and the name exactly
suited him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you come all alone?&#8221; asked Lady
Hamilton.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeth, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; replied Tom, rolling up his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
eyes in pretended diffidence. &#8220;My nurthie
went to a ball game, tho I had to come all by
mythelf. But I&#8217;th a big dirl, now!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are indeed,&#8221; said Patty, glancing at his
stalwart proportions, &#8220;but you&#8217;re surely the
belle of this ball.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Grace Meredith was a little Dutch girl, and
was charming in the picturesque Holland headgear,
and a tight-waisted, long-skirted blue
gown, that just cleared the tops of her clattering
wooden sabots. She talked a Dutch dialect,
or rather, what she imagined was such, and if
not real Hollandese, it was at least, very amusing
and funny.
</p>
<p>Mabel Hartley looked very sweet as Little Red
Riding-Hood, and she carried a little basket on
her arm, which contained a real pat of butter.
</p>
<p>Sinclair and Bob Hartley were the Princes in
the Tower, and the black velvet suits and white
lace collars were exceedingly becoming to them.
They wore wigs of long flaxen hair, and often
fell into the pose of the celebrated picture, to
the delight of all who saw them. But when not
posing as a tableau, they were so full of antics
that Patty told them they were more like Court
Jesters than Princes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Clowns, you mean,&#8221; said Bob, as with a flash
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
of his black satin legs he leap-frogged over Sinclair&#8217;s
back.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Behave yourselves, Princes!&#8221; admonished
Patty, and in a second, the two stood motionless,
side by side, as in the great painting.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You certainly must be photographed like
that,&#8221; exclaimed Lady Hamilton; and then a
brilliant idea came to her and she sent a message
at once to a well-known photographer to
send one of his men and a camera at once.
</p>
<p>And so, the regular programme of the party
was suspended while photographs of the guests
were taken. Singly and in groups they were
snapped off as fast as the camera could be adjusted,
and Lady Hamilton promised to send
copies to their homes later.
</p>
<p>Some of the young people had hired very
elaborate costumes and represented celebrated
works of art.
</p>
<p>Gainsborough&#8217;s &#8220;Blue Boy,&#8221; and Velasquez&#8217;
&#8220;Maria Teresa,&#8221; were truly beautiful, while
Van Dyck&#8217;s &#8220;Baby Stuart,&#8221; made a lovely picture.
But equally interesting were the less pretentious
characters and costumes.
</p>
<p>Simple Simon was a favourite with all. A
faded blue smock frock, and a battered old hat
formed his characteristic garb, and long,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
straight yellow locks, and a stupid, open-mouthed
expression of face made him look like
the traditional Simon. He was a boy of much
original wit, and his funny repartee proved him,
in reality, far from simple-minded.
</p>
<p>Little Miss Muffet was present, and Struwelpeter,
and &#8220;Alice,&#8221; and a merry brother and
sister had to cut up many roguish antics before
they were recognised as &#8220;The Heavenly
Twins.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary, wore a pretty
Dolly Varden costume, and carried a watering-pot,
while Little Boy Blue shyly blew his horn at
her. There were several Lord Fauntleroys, and
Buster Browns and Rollos, and also a great
many who represented nobody in particular, but
just a dear little child.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fairfield and Nan, though they had said
they would come to the party dressed as children,
had changed their minds, and arrived later
than the others, wearing the garb of elderly
people.
</p>
<p>They said they were the grandparents, come
to look at the children enjoy themselves.
</p>
<p>Nan made a very sweet old lady, with white
wig, and gold glasses, while Mr. Fairfield pretended
to be an old man, cross and gouty. But
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
so funny was his ferocious crustiness that nobody
felt in awe of him.
</p>
<p>Led by Lady Hamilton, the boys and girls
played all sorts of merry children&#8217;s games.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ring Around a Rosy,&#8221; &#8220;London Bridge is
Falling Down,&#8221; &#8220;Hide the Thimble,&#8221; and
other such infantile entertainments proved exceedingly
mirth-provoking. The big babies
were continually crying over fancied woes, and
sometimes even the historic characters grew
humorously quarrelsome.
</p>
<p>At half-past four supper was served. The
children were formed in pairs for a grand
march. To the strains of &#8220;The Baby&#8217;s Opera&#8221;
they marched to another room, where a long
table was set for them.
</p>
<p>At each place was a bread-and-milk set, and a
mug which was lettered in gilt, &#8220;For a Good
Child.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The mugs were especially pretty ones, and
were to be taken home as souvenirs. At each
place was a bib with strings, and when these
were tied around their necks, the big &#8220;children&#8221;
looked absurd indeed.
</p>
<p>In keeping with their assumed rôles, their table
manners were not impeccable, and many fists
pounded on the table, while babyish voices
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
said: &#8220;Me wants me thupper,&#8221; or &#8220;Div me
some beddy-butter!&#8221; But though the bowls
and mugs betokened infantile fare, the supper
really served included dainty salads and sandwiches,
followed by ices, jellies and cakes, and
was fully enjoyed by the healthy appetites which
belong to young people of eighteen or thereabouts.
</p>
<p>After supper, they returned to the drawing-room
for a dance.
</p>
<p>Delightful music was played, and it was a
pretty sight to see the fancy costumes gracefully
flit about in the dance.
</p>
<p>When it was nearly time to go home, one of
the &#8220;nurses&#8221; came to Lady Hamilton saying
that a belated guest had arrived.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is it?&#8221; asked Lady Hamilton, surprised
that any one should arrive so late.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He says he is Peter Pan,&#8221; answered the
maid.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Show him in, at once,&#8221; said Lady Hamilton,
&#8220;we surely want to see Peter Pan&mdash;the boy
who never <i>could</i> grow up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And then through the doorway came a figure
that unmistakably represented Peter Pan.
</p>
<p>The well-known costume of russet browns and
autumn-leaf tints, the small, close cap with its
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
single feather, and the fierce-looking dagger
were all there. To be sure, it was a much
<i>larger</i> Peter Pan than any of them had seen in
the play, but otherwise it was surely Peter.
</p>
<p>At first, Lady Hamilton looked completely bewildered,
and then, as she realised that it was
really her own father, she turned pale and then
very pink.
</p>
<p>Patty stood near her, and though she didn&#8217;t
know what might happen, she felt sure Lady
Hamilton would be quite able to cope with the
situation.
</p>
<p>And so she was. After the first dazed moment,
she stepped forward, and offering her hand,
said cordially:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Welcome, Peter Pan! We are indeed glad
to see you. We&#8217;re sorry you couldn&#8217;t come
earlier, but pray fall right into place with the
rest of our little guests.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was the nature of Sir Otho Markleham to
do thoroughly whatever he did at all.
</p>
<p>So, now, throwing himself into the spirit of the
moment, he made friends with the young people
at once. He entertained them with stories of
his thrilling adventures with the pirates; he told
them how he lost his shadow, he explained all
about Fairies, and soon the other guests were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
all crowded about him, listening breathlessly to
his talk.
</p>
<p>Lady Hamilton, standing a little to one side of
the listening group, looked at her father. She
realised at once what it all meant. She knew
that Patty had persuaded him to come, and that
it meant complete reconciliation between father
and daughter. The whole matter could be discussed
later, if they chose, but the mere presence
of her father beneath her roof meant forgiveness
and peace between them.
</p>
<p>Softly Patty came up beside her and clasped
her hand. &#8220;You&#8217;re a witch,&#8221; whispered Lady
Hamilton, as she warmly returned the pressure.
&#8220;How did you ever accomplish this?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind that, now,&#8221; said Patty, her eyes
shining. &#8220;Are you glad?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad! Yes, only that&#8217;s a short word to express
my joy and my gratitude to you. But you
took a risk! Suppose I had fainted, or done
something foolish in my great surprise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I knew you better than that,&#8221; returned
Patty. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t he a dear in that Peter Pan
suit? And, only think, he took off his beloved
&#8216;sideboards,&#8217; so he&#8217;d look the character
better.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll soon grow again,&#8221; said Lady Hamilton,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
carelessly; &#8220;but what I can&#8217;t understand
is why he came at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because he loves you,&#8221; whispered Patty,
&#8220;and you love him. And you&#8217;ve both been
acting like silly geese, but now that&#8217;s all
over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is!&#8221; And Lady Hamilton gave a
soft sigh of relief. Then, following her father&#8217;s
example, she devoted herself to her young
guests, and the time passed pleasantly until their
departure.
</p>
<p>Of course, these young people knew nothing of
the state of affairs between &#8220;Peter Pan&#8221; and
his hostess, though they soon discovered the
identity of Sir Otho.
</p>
<p>Soon after six, the &#8220;children&#8221; went away, declaring
that it had been the event of the season,
and they had never enjoyed a party more. The
three Fairfields took leave at the same time, and
Lady Hamilton was left alone with her father.
</p>
<p>Exactly what was said in the next half hour
neither of them ever told, but when it was past,
the two were entirely reconciled, and Lady
Kitty had consented to return to her father&#8217;s
house to live. Then she sent a note to the Fairfields,
asking them all to dine with herself and
her father that evening.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And meantime, Kitty,&#8221; said Sir Otho, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
go and get out of this foolish toggery.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but save that suit to be photographed
in. I must have your picture to put with those
of the other &#8216;children.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sir Otho went away, enveloped in a long raincoat,
and promising to return at the dinner
hour. It was a merry dinner party that night.
</p>
<p>Patty had a new frock in honour of the occasion,
and as she donned the pretty demi-toilette
of pale green gauze, Nan said it was
the most becoming costume she had ever worn.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that you&#8217;re really eighteen, Patty,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;I think you might discard hair-ribbons.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thank you,&#8221; said Patty, as Louise tied
her big, white bow for her. &#8220;I&#8217;ll wear them a
little longer. At least as long as I&#8217;m in this
country where Dukes and Earls run wild.
When I get back to New York, I&#8217;ll see about
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-evening, Miss Yankee Doodle,&#8221; said
Sir Otho, as he met her again at dinner. &#8220;Once
more the American has conquered the English,
and I would be greatly honoured by your kind
acceptance of this tiny memento of the occasion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As Sir Otho spoke, he handed Patty a small
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
jeweller&#8217;s box. She opened it and saw a dear
little brooch in the form of an American flag.
The Stars and Stripes were made of small sparkling
brilliants of the three colours, and the
twinkling effect was very beautiful.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is lovely!&#8221; she exclaimed; &#8220;how can I
ever thank you! This is one of my very choicest
birthday gifts, and I have received a great
many.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is nothing,&#8221; said Sir Otho, &#8220;compared to
what you have given me,&#8221; and he glanced affectionately
toward his daughter.
</p>
<p>And this was all he ever said by way of expressing
his gratitude to Patty, but it was
enough, for the deep tone of his voice, and the
suggestion of tears in his eyes, proved his inexpressible
appreciation of Patty&#8217;s achievement.
</p>
<p>Then the matter was dropped entirely, and the
conversation became general and gay. Sir Otho
proved to be as entertaining to older people as
he had been to the children at the party, and
Lady Kitty was in her most charming mood.
Mr. and Mrs. Fairfield quite did their share
toward the general entertainment, but Patty
was queen of the feast. She enjoyed it all, for
she dearly loved a festivity of any sort, but to-night
she was specially happy to think that her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
plan had succeeded, and that she had given to
her dear friend Kitty what she most wanted
in all the world.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I trust it will not be long,&#8221; said Sir
Otho, &#8220;before you will all accept an invitation
to dine with me in Carlton Terrace, with Lady
Hamilton presiding at my table.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This invitation was delightedly accepted, and
then they all went up to the Fairfields&#8217; drawing-room,
and Patty sang songs, and they all
sang choruses, and then, as a final surprise,
came a great, beautiful birthday cake, with
eighteen lighted candles.
</p>
<p>Then Patty cut the cake, and there were more
congratulations and good wishes all round, and
for pretty nearly the eighteenth time in her life
Patty declared it was the best birthday she
had ever had.

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>SUMMER PLANS</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;As usual,&#8221; said Mr. Fairfield, smiling,
&#8220;the question is, what is to be done with
Patty?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Patty, complacently, &#8220;you and
Nan are usually trying to dispose of me in some
way. It&#8217;s lucky I&#8217;m good-natured and don&#8217;t
mind being left behind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a pretty speech!&#8221; exclaimed Nan,
&#8220;after we&#8217;ve begged and coaxed you to go
with us!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you have, my pretty little Stepmother&mdash;so
you have; and I&#8217;m just ungrateful enough not
to want to go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was about a week after the birthday party,
and the Fairfields were making their plans for
the summer. The elders wanted to travel in
Switzerland and Germany. Patty did not want
to go with them, but her dilemma was, which
of several delightful invitations to accept.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;I&#8217;m invited to spend
June in five separate places, each one lovelier
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
than the other. Now I can&#8217;t chop myself up
into five pieces.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can chop June up into five pieces,&#8221; suggested
Nan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but if I go to a country house to make
a good long visit, I want to stay about a month.
A week here and then a week there is so unsatisfactory.
However, after much thoughtful
brooding over the question, I&#8217;ve cut out three,
and that brings my quandary down to only two
places to decide between.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lady Hamilton&#8217;s being one,&#8221; observed her
father.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Kitty&#8217;s is one; and Mabel Hartley&#8217;s is
the other. Of course, if I spend June with
Kitty, we&#8217;ll be right here in London all the
time, and though I love it, yet I love the country
too. Now, if I go to Mabel&#8217;s, I&#8217;ll have a beautiful
experience of real English country life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You would enjoy it, I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; said Nan;
&#8220;and I think you&#8217;d better decide to go to Cromarty
Manor, and then, if for any reason, you
don&#8217;t like it, come back, and put in the rest of
your time with Lady Kitty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nan, that&#8217;s an inspiration!&#8221; cried Patty,
running across the room, and clasping Nan in
one of her rather strenuous embraces.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Look out! You&#8217;ll break her!&#8221; cried Mr.
Fairfield, in great pretence of fear.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed!&#8221; said Patty, &#8220;she&#8217;s too substantial.
And anyway, such a clever suggestion
deserves ample recognition.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty sat on the arm of Nan&#8217;s chair, and
amused herself by twisting Nan&#8217;s curly hair into
tight little spirals.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop that, Patty,&#8221; said her father; &#8220;you
make Nan look like a pickaninny.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter what she looks like, if it&#8217;s becoming,&#8221;
said Patty, serenely. &#8220;But truly, Nan,
you ought to wear your hair like that; it&#8217;s awfully
effective!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The spirals now stood out all round Nan&#8217;s
face, like a spiky frame, but the good-natured
victim only laughed, as she said, &#8220;Never mind
me, let&#8217;s get these great questions settled.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So, after some more talk and discussion, it was
settled that Patty should accept the Hartleys&#8217;
urgent invitation to Cromarty Manor, for, at
least, a part of June, and then, if she cared
to, stay also a time with Lady Hamilton.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It may sound silly,&#8221; said Patty, thoughtfully,
&#8220;but I can&#8217;t help feeling that Mabel not
only wants me to visit her this summer, but
she needs me. Now, I don&#8217;t mean to be conceited,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
but, don&#8217;t you know, you can tell when
people seem to need you, if only in a trivial
way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; said Nan, quickly; &#8220;and
you&#8217;re not conceited a bit, Patty. Mabel does
need you. She is a sweet girl, but sometimes
she seems to me the least bit morbid; no, not
quite that, but verging that way. She adores
you, and I&#8217;m perfectly sure that your companionship
will do her a world of good.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; said Patty; &#8220;I love Mabel, but
there is something about her I can&#8217;t quite understand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll probably find out what it is, when
you&#8217;re staying with her,&#8221; said her father, &#8220;and
I know, Patty, you&#8217;ll do all in your power to
brighten her up. The Merediths live near
them, don&#8217;t they?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; only a mile or two away. And the
Merediths are gay enough for anybody. If
they&#8217;re at home this summer, there&#8217;ll be plenty
of fun going on, I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lady Hamilton will miss you a lot,&#8221; said
Nan; &#8220;what does she say to your going?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, she says she&#8217;ll miss me,&#8221; said Patty,
&#8220;and so she will, some, but it&#8217;s not like it was
when she was here, alone. Now that she&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
settled in her father&#8217;s house again, she has so
much to occupy her time and attention she&#8217;s
never lonely. Of course, she&#8217;s just as fond of
me, and I am of her, but since she&#8217;s gone away
from here, I don&#8217;t see so much of her. And,
truly, she doesn&#8217;t need me, and Mabel does.
So I&#8217;ll go to Mabel&#8217;s first, and I shouldn&#8217;t be
surprised if I stay there until you people come
back from your trip. Mrs. Hartley asked me
for the whole summer, you know, but you won&#8217;t
be gone more than a month or six weeks, will
you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not more than two months,&#8221; answered her
father, &#8220;and you know, chickabiddy, if ever you
want to join us, I&#8217;ll send for you, or come for
you myself, whenever you say the word. Just
telegraph me, and I&#8217;ll respond at once.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right; I will if I want to. But there&#8217;s
too much fun for me in civilization to want to
go wandering off to the ends of the earth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you may decide to go to Herenden
Hall for a time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I may. I&#8217;d love to visit Lady Herenden
again, if I thought that Earl gentleman
wouldn&#8217;t be there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He probably won&#8217;t be,&#8221; said Nan. &#8220;I daresay
you scared him away from there forever.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Even so, I didn&#8217;t scare him as much as he
scared me,&#8221; returned Patty, &#8220;but I do hope
there won&#8217;t be any Earls at Cromarty. I like
plain, big boys better.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Those Hartley boys are fine fellows,&#8221; observed
Mr. Fairfield. &#8220;Young Meredith has
more fun and jollity, but the Hartleys are of a
sterling good sort. I like the whole family, and
I&#8217;m glad, Patty girl, that you&#8217;ve decided to go
there. I&#8217;ll willingly leave you in Mrs. Hartley&#8217;s
care, and I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll have a good
time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I shall, Daddy, and I&#8217;ll write you
every day, if you want me to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not quite so often, my dear. Twice a week,
will be all you&#8217;ll find time for, I&#8217;m certain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite likely,&#8221; said Patty, who was not very
fond of writing letters.
</p>
<p>Only a week later, Patty was to go away with
the Hartleys. And a week was not a very
long time for her preparations. There was
shopping to do, and calling, and, as Nan and
Mr. Fairfield were leaving at the same time,
they were to give up their hotel apartment for
the present.
</p>
<p>But Lady Hamilton insisted that Patty must
look upon Sir Otho&#8217;s big house in Carlton Terrace
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
as her own home. If she cared to run up
to London for a few days at any time, she
would be more than welcome at Lady Kitty&#8217;s.
Or she could leave there any trunks or other belongings
that she wished. This greatly pleased
Mr. Fairfield, for he felt more comfortable at
leaving Patty, to know that she had a foothold
in London, and somebody to look after her,
should she care to leave Cromarty before her
parents&#8217; return.
</p>
<p>At last the day of departure came, and Mr.
Fairfield accompanied Patty to the station to
meet the Hartleys for the journey.
</p>
<p>It was with a homesick heart that Patty bade
her father good-bye. Somehow, she suddenly
felt that she was leaving her own people to go
away with strangers. But she knew she must
not be foolish, so she bravely kept back the
tears and said good-bye with a tender, if not a
gay, smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the loveliest thing,&#8221; said Mabel, after
they were settled in the train, &#8220;to think that
you&#8217;re really going with us. I wanted you to,
so dreadfully, but I didn&#8217;t urge it very much,
for fear you wouldn&#8217;t enjoy yourself with us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I always enjoy myself,&#8221; said Patty, &#8220;but I
know I shall be happy with you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll try to make you so, Miss Fairfield,&#8221;
said Bob, earnestly, and Patty smiled at him,
and said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the first thing you can do toward it, is
to drop that formal name, and call me Patty.
I&#8217;m not really grown-up enough for the other.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t think you are,&#8221; said Bob, as he
looked at her critically. &#8220;So, as we&#8217;re all to
live under one roof for a time, we&#8217;ll be first
namers all round.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; said Sinclair, &#8220;that suits me; and
now, Mater, when you&#8217;re ready, we&#8217;ll go in to
luncheon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty thought luncheon in the dining car was
great fun. Only four could sit at a table, but
as Mrs. Hartley had a slight headache and did
not care to talk, she and Grandma Cromarty
sat at another table, and left the four young
people to chatter by themselves.
</p>
<p>Everything interested Patty, from the unusual
things she found on the menu to the strange
sights she saw from the window.
</p>
<p>This was her first trip in this direction, for
they were travelling toward Leicester, and the
scenes were all new to her.
</p>
<p>The boys were full of fun and nonsense, and
Mabel was so gay and jolly that Patty began
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
to think she had imagined the girl was of a sad
nature. They all told funny stories, and made
absurd jokes, and poked fun at each other, and
Patty concluded she was likely to have a very
jolly summer with the Hartleys. Back they
went after luncheon to their funny parlour car,
which had double seats facing each other, with
a small table between.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just the place for a game,&#8221; said Sinclair, as
the four took their seats, two on either side of
the table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What sort of a game?&#8221; asked Patty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know; I&#8217;ll make one up.&#8221; The
boy took a bit of chalk from his pocket, and
marked off the table into various sections, with
a circle in each corner, and crosses here and
there.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he explained, as he offered each
player a coin, &#8220;this isn&#8217;t money, you know.
They&#8217;re merely counters, for the time being.
But when the game is over you must all give
them back to me, because they&#8217;ll be money again
then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what do we do with them?&#8221; asked
Patty, who was greatly interested in any game.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you. These places are homes, and
these are wilderness. If you&#8217;re in the wilderness
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
you may be captured, but if you&#8217;re at home,
you can&#8217;t be.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The game was really a mix-up of parcheesi,
halma, and some others; to which were added
some original rules out of Sinclair&#8217;s own head.
Patty and Bob were partners against the other
two, and soon the quartette were deeply absorbed
in the game.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are the cleverest boy, to make this up!&#8221;
cried Patty, as her side won, and they prepared
to begin over again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he often makes up games,&#8221; said Mabel.
&#8220;We all do, only Sinclair&#8217;s are always the best.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mine are very good, though,&#8221; observed
Bob, modestly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good enough, yes,&#8221; said Sinclair; &#8220;only usually
they&#8217;re so difficult that nobody can win but
yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bob made a profound bow at this compliment,
and then the game went on. It seemed
impossible that they had been about five hours
on the train, when it was time to get out. They
had reached Leicester, and from there were to
drive to Cromarty Manor.
</p>
<p>Two vehicles met them at the station.
</p>
<p>Into one of these, a comfortable victoria, Sinclair
assisted the four ladies, and in the other,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
the boys rode up with the luggage. The drive
was beautiful, and Patty warmly expressed her
gratitude to Mrs. Hartley, for inviting her to
this delightful experience of English country
life.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is beautiful,&#8221; said Mrs. Hartley, looking
about her. &#8220;I&#8217;m always glad to get back from
London to the restful quiet of these great trees
and the far-away, peaceful hills.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mabel&#8217;s mood had changed. She no longer
laughed and jested, and though sweet and gentle
as ever, the hint of sadness had again crept into
her face, and her speech was slow and quiet.
Patty adapted her mood to the other&#8217;s, and it
was almost in silence they drove along the
country roads.
</p>
<p>It was a long ride, and it was nearly dusk
when at last they arrived at Cromarty
Manor.
</p>
<p>An old servant came out from the Porter&#8217;s
Lodge to open the high iron gates for them.
</p>
<p>He gave them a warm greeting, which seemed
a heart-felt welcome, and not merely the speech
of a paid dependant, and then they drove on
toward the house.
</p>
<p>The whole effect was so beautiful that it almost
took Patty&#8217;s breath away. It was not a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
bit like Herenden Hall, it was more like an old
feudal castle. The picturesque house was of
gray stone, with towers and turrets almost entirely
covered with ivy. From the ivy the birds
flew in and out, and the darkness of the surrounding
trees and tall shrubbery gave the place
a weird and fairly mysterious appearance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You feel the charm of it, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; said
Mrs. Hartley, kindly, as she looked at Patty&#8217;s
rapt face and serious eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed,&#8221; said Patty, softly; &#8220;I can&#8217;t explain
it, but it casts a spell over me. Oh, I
don&#8217;t wonder you love it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>But the darkness of the outer world was soon
dispelled by a broad gleam of light, as the
great front doors were thrown open. An old,
gray-haired butler stood on the threshold, and
greeted them with rather pompous respect and
punctilious deference. The interior was quite
in keeping with the outside view of the house.
But though the old carved rafters and wainscoting
were dark and heavy, cheerful lamps
were in abundance, and in the halls and drawing-rooms,
wax candles were lighted also.
</p>
<p>At the first view on entering there seemed to
be an interminable vista of rooms, that opened
one from another; this was partly the effect of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
the elaborate old architecture, and partly because
of many long mirrors in various positions.
</p>
<p>The furniture, tapestries and ornaments were
all of an epoch two centuries back, and the
whole picture fascinated Patty beyond all words.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a wonderful place,&#8221; she said at last;
&#8220;and after a week or two, I&#8217;m going to examine
it in detail. But at first I shall be satisfied just
to bask in its atmosphere.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll do!&#8221; cried Bob, who had just arrived.
&#8220;If you hadn&#8217;t appreciated Cromarty, we were
going to pack you straight back to London; but
you&#8217;ve acquitted yourself nobly. Nobody could
make a better speech than you did, and I&#8217;ll
wager you didn&#8217;t learn it beforehand either.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Patty, &#8220;because I didn&#8217;t
know what the place was like. What few remarks
you made about it seem like nothing,
now that I&#8217;ve begun to see it for myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and you&#8217;ve only begun,&#8221; said Sinclair.
&#8220;To-morrow, when you get further into the
heart of it, you&#8217;ll surrender to its charm as
we all do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I shall,&#8221; agreed Patty, &#8220;and, indeed,
I think I have already done so.&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>CROMARTY MANOR</h3>
</div>

<p>Life at Cromarty Manor was very pleasant
indeed.
</p>
<p>Although Patty had not definitely realised
it, she was thoroughly tired out by her
London gaieties, and the peaceful quiet of the
country brought her a rest that she truly needed.
</p>
<p>Also, the Hartleys were a delightful family
to visit. There is quite as much hospitality in
knowing when to leave guests to themselves as
there is in continually entertaining them.
</p>
<p>And while the Hartleys planned many pleasures
for Patty, yet there were also hours in
the morning or early afternoon, when she was
free to follow her own sweet will.
</p>
<p>Sometimes she would roam around the historic
old house, pausing here and there in some
of the silent, unused rooms, to imagine romances
of days gone by.
</p>
<p>Sometimes she would stroll out-of-doors,
through the orchards and woods, by ravines and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
brooks, always discovering some new and beautiful
vista or bit of scenery.
</p>
<p>And often she would spend a morning, lying
in a hammock beneath the old trees, reading a
book, or merely day-dreaming, as she watched
the sunlight play hide-and-seek among the leaves
above her head.
</p>
<p>One morning, after she had been at Cromarty
Manor for about a week, Patty betook herself
to her favourite hammock, carrying with her a
book of Fairy Tales, for which she had never
outgrown her childish fondness.
</p>
<p>But the book remained unopened, for Patty&#8217;s
mind was full of busy thoughts.
</p>
<p>She looked around at the beautiful landscape
which, as far as the eye could reach included
only the land belonging to the Cromarty estate.
There were more than a thousand acres
in all, much of which was cultivated ground,
and the rest woodland or rolling meadows.
Patty looked at the dark woods in the distance;
the orchards nearer by; and, in her immediate
vicinity, the beautiful gardens and
terraces.
</p>
<p>The latter, of which there were two, known
as the Upper and Lower Terrace, were two
hundred feet long and were separated by a sloping
bank of green lawn, dotted with round
flower beds.
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
<a name='linki_4' id='linki_4'></a>
<img src='images/illus-174.jpg' alt='' title='' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
&#8220;Often she would spend a morning lying in a hammock<br />
beneath the old trees&#8221;
<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></div>
<p>Above the terraces rose the old house itself.
The Manor was built of a grayish stone, and
was of Elizabethan architecture.
</p>
<p>More than two hundred years old, it had been
remodelled and added to by its various successive
owners, but much of its fine old, original
plan was left.
</p>
<p>Ivy clung to its walls, and birds fluttered in and
out continually.
</p>
<p>There was a tower on either side the great
entrance, and Patty loved to fancy that awful
and mysterious deeds had been committed
within those frowning walls.
</p>
<p>But there was no legend or tradition attached
to the mansion, and all its history seemed to
be peaceful and pleasant.
</p>
<p>Even the quaint old yew-tree walk, with its
strangely misshapen shrubbery, was bright and
cheerful in the morning sunlight, and the lake
rippled like silver, and gave no hint of dark
or gloomy depths.
</p>
<p>And yet, Patty couldn&#8217;t help feeling that there
was some shadow hanging over the Hartley
family. They were never sad or low-spirited,
but sometimes Mrs. Hartley would sigh, or
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
Grandma Cromarty would look anxious, as if at
some unrelievable sorrow.
</p>
<p>The boys were always light-hearted and gay,
but Mabel often had moods of despondency,
which, while they never made her cross or irritable,
were so pathetic that it worried Patty&#8217;s
loving heart.
</p>
<p>And so she lay in her hammock, gazing at the
beauty all about her, and wondering what was
the secret grief that harassed her dear friends.
It never occurred to her that it was none of
her affair, for Patty was possessed of a healthy
curiosity, and moreover she was innately of a
helpful nature, and longed to know what the
trouble was, in a vague hope that she might be
of some assistance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know they&#8217;re not rich,&#8221; she said to herself,
&#8220;for the whole place shows neglect and shabbiness;
but there&#8217;s something besides lack of
money that makes Madam Cromarty sad.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The place was indeed in a state of unrepair.
Though there were many servants, there were
not enough to do all that should have been done.
The two gardeners did their best to keep the
flowers in order, but the elaborate conventional
gardens, laid out in geometric designs, and intricate
paths, called for a complete staff of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
trained workers, and in the absence of these, became
overgrown at their borders and untidy in
appearance.
</p>
<p>It was the same indoors. The handsome old
furniture, covered with silk brocades and tapestries,
was worn and sometimes ragged in appearance.
Some of the decorations showed need of
regilding, and though the magnificent old carved
woodwork, and tessellated floors could not be
marred by time, yet many of the lesser appointments
called for renovation or renewal. The
Great Hall, as it was called, had best withstood
the ravages of time, as it was wainscoted and
ceiled in massive old oak.
</p>
<p>It was a noble apartment, with recessed windows
and panelled walls, and across one end
was a raised platform from the back of
which rose a wonderfully carved chimney-piece.
</p>
<p>This apartment, in the palmier days of the
Manor House, had been the Banqueting Hall,
but as there was a smaller and more appropriate
dining-room, the Hartleys used the Great
Hall as a living room, and had gathered in
it their dearest treasures and belongings.
Grandma Cromarty had her own corner, with
her knitting basket. In another corner was a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
grand piano, and many other musical instruments.
In one north bay window was Mabel&#8217;s
painting outfit, and so large was the recess that
it formed a good-sized studio. On the walls,
hobnobbing with the ancient antlers and deers&#8217;
heads, trophies of the chase, were the boys&#8217; tennis
rackets, and in the outstretched arm of a
tall figure in armour, a lot of golfsticks rested
against the quartered shield.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; Mabel had said, when they first
showed this room to Patty, &#8220;a great many
people would consider it desecration to fill up
this fine old place with all our modern stuff.
But we&#8217;re modern, and so we make the carving
and tapestries give way to us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They like it,&#8221; Patty had replied. &#8220;They
feel sorry for other houses where the carvings
and tapestries have to stay back in their own
old times. Now hear these old rafters ring to
modern music,&#8221; and seating herself at the piano,
Patty began some rollicking songs that were of
decidedly later date than the old rafters.
</p>
<p>Opening from the old Banqueting Hall was
the library. This had been left just as it was,
and the shelves full of old books were a never-failing
delight to Patty&#8217;s browsing nature. A
gallery ran round all four sides, which was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
reached by spiral iron staircases, and the deep-seated
windows, with their old leather cushions,
made delightful nooks in which to pore over
the old volumes. There were many unused
rooms in the Manor House. Many unexpected
alcoves and corridors, and in these the old furniture
was worn and decayed. The rooms that
were lived in were kept in comfortable order,
but Patty knew, had there been more house-servants,
these other apartments would have
been thrown open to light and air.
</p>
<p>Surely, Patty decided, the Hartleys were
pinched for money, but just as surely, she
thought, that could not have the effect of casting
that indefinite gloom over them which was
now and then observable. And as she idly
swung in her hammock, she made up her mind
to ask about it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If they don&#8217;t want to tell me, they needn&#8217;t,&#8221;
she said to herself, &#8220;but they surely know me
well enough now to know that I&#8217;m honestly interested
in their life, and not merely trying to
pry into their secrets.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But she could not quite decide which one of the
family to ask about it. She would have preferred
to ask Grandma Cromarty, but the old
lady had a certain reserve, which, at times, was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
forbidding, and Patty stood a little in awe of
her.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hartley was kindly and responsive, but
Patty rarely saw her except when the whole
family was present. In the morning Mrs.
Hartley was busy with household duties, and
afternoons Patty and Mabel were usually together.
Patty felt sure she could never ask
Mabel, for though the two girls were confidential
friends, there was a sensitiveness in Mabel&#8217;s
disposition that made Patty shrink from touching
on what she felt might be a painful subject.
Then there were the boys. Bob, at home on his
vacation from college was Patty&#8217;s chum and
merry comrade, but she imagined he would
cleverly evade a serious question. He was always
chaffing, and while Patty was always glad
to meet him on this ground, she almost knew
he wouldn&#8217;t talk seriously on family subjects.
This left only Sinclair. Patty really liked Sinclair
Hartley. A young man of about twenty,
he was studying law in a nearby town, where
he went every morning, returning in mid-afternoon.
</p>
<p>He was kindly and courteous, and though often
grave, was always appreciative of a joke, and
quite ready to join in any fun. But he had a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
serious side, and Patty had enjoyed many long
talks with him on subjects that never would
interest Mabel or Bob.
</p>
<p>And so she concluded that at the first opportunity,
she would ask Sinclair what was the nature
of the mystery that seemed to hang over the
House of Hartley.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, there, Pitty-Pat!&#8221; called a gay voice,
and looking around, Patty saw Bob strolling toward
her across the lawn. &#8220;Want to go out on
the lake and fish for pond-lilies?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed,&#8221; said Patty, twisting herself
out of the hammock. &#8220;What are you going to
do with them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, just for the lunch table. Mabel&#8217;s so
everlastingly fond of them, you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty thought it was nice of Bob to remember
his sister&#8217;s tastes, and she willingly went with
him toward the lake.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How beautiful it all is!&#8221; she said as they
went down the terrace steps and along the lake
path which led through a pergola and around a
curved corner called &#8220;The Alcove.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This delightful nook was a small open court
of marble, adorned with pillars and statues, and
partly surrounding a fountain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; exclaimed Bob, enthusiastically.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
&#8220;You know, Patty, this old place is my
joy and my despair. I love every stick and
stone of it, but I wish we could keep it up in
decent order. Heigh-ho! Just wait until I&#8217;m
out of college. I&#8217;ll do something then to turn an
honest shilling, and every penny of it shall go
to fix up the dear old place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to be, Bob?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;An engineer. There&#8217;s more chance for a
fellow in that than in any other profession.
Old Sinclair&#8217;s for being a lawyer, and he&#8217;ll be
a good one, too, but it&#8217;s slow work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to go to America, Bob, if you
want to get rich.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I would, like a shot, if I could take the old
house with me. But I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s too big to
uproot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it is. I suppose you wouldn&#8217;t like
to live in a brown-stone front on Fifth
Avenue?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never having seen your brown-stone Avenue,
ma&#8217;am, I can&#8217;t say; but I suppose a deer park
and lake and several thousand acres of meadow
land are not included with each house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; not unless you take the whole of Manhattan
Island.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Even that wouldn&#8217;t do; unless I had taken
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
it a few hundred years ago, and started the
trees growing then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, America wouldn&#8217;t suit you,&#8221; said Patty,
thoughtfully, &#8220;any more than English country
life would suit most of our American boys.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you like this life of ours?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I love it; for a time. And just now I am
enjoying it immensely. Oh, what gorgeous
lilies!&#8221;
</p>
<p>They had reached the lake, and the quiet, well-behaved
water was placidly rippling against the
stone coping.
</p>
<p>Bob untied the boat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an old thing,&#8221; he said, regretfully; &#8220;but
it&#8217;s water-tight, so don&#8217;t be afraid.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty went down the broad marble steps, and
seated herself in the stern of the boat, while
Bob took the rowing seat.
</p>
<p>A few of his strong pulls, and they were out
among the lily pads.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Row around a bit before we gather them,&#8221;
suggested Patty, and Bob with long, slow
strokes sent the boat softly and steadily along.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it perfect?&#8221; said Patty, dreamily. &#8220;It
seems as if nothing could stir me up on a day
like this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221; said Bob, and with mischief in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
his eyes, he began to rock the boat from side
to side.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You villain!&#8221; cried Patty, rudely stirred
from her calm enjoyment; &#8220;take that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She dashed light sprays of water at him from
over the side of the boat, and he returned by
cleverly sprinkling a few drops on her from
the blade of his oar.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you want to kick up a bobbery,
when everything was so nice and peaceful?&#8221;
she said, reproachfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall always kick up a bobbery,&#8221; he returned,
calmly, &#8220;when you put on that romantic,
sentimental air.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t put on any sentimental air! I was
just enjoying the dreamy spirit of the lake.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you! That&#8217;s the same as saying my
society makes you sleepy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing of the sort. And anyway, the
dreamy mood has passed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I intended it should. Now, let&#8217;s sing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right; what?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The &#8216;Little Kibosh,&#8217; I think. That&#8217;s a good
song to row by.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The young people at Cromarty Manor had
already composed several songs which seemed
to them choicest gems of musical composition.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></p>
<p>As a rule Patty and Bob made up the words,
while Mabel and Sinclair arranged the tunes.
</p>
<p>Sometimes the airs were adapted from well-known
songs, and sometimes they were entirely
original.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Little Kibosh&#8221; was one of their favourite
nonsense songs, and now Patty and Bob
sang it in unison as they rowed slowly about
on the lake.

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>UNCLE MARMADUKE</h3>
</div>

<p>That very same evening Patty had a
chance to speak to Sinclair alone.
</p>
<p>It was just after dinner, and the lovely
English twilight was beginning to cast long,
soft shadows of the tall cypresses across the
lawn. The various members of the family were
standing about on the terrace, when Sinclair
said, &#8220;You need some exercise, Patty; let&#8217;s
walk as far as the alcove.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty assented, and the two strolled away,
while Mabel called after them, &#8220;Don&#8217;t be gone
long, for we&#8217;re all going to play games this
evening.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They all loved games, so Patty promised to return
very soon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never saw anything like this alcove before
in my life,&#8221; said Patty, as they reached the picturesque
spot and sat down upon the curving
marble seat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are often found in the gardens of old
English homes. Any arched or covered seat
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
out of doors is called an alcove. But this is
rather an elaborate one. The marble pillars are
of fine design, and the whole thing is beautifully
proportioned.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it very old?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, older than the house. You know the
Cromartys have lived on this estate for several
hundred years. But the original house was destroyed
by fire, or nearly so, and the present
house was built on the old foundations about
the middle of the seventeenth century. If
you&#8217;re interested in these things, there are lots
of books in the library, telling all about the history
of the place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed I am interested, and I shall look up
the books, if you&#8217;ll tell me what they are. Is
there any legend or tradition connected with the
place?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. We have no ghosts at Cromarty
Manor. We&#8217;ve always been a peaceful sort, except
that my great uncle quarrelled with my
grandfather.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Cromarty&#8217;s husband?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. He was Roger Cromarty&mdash;grandfather
was, I mean&mdash;and he had a brother
Marmaduke. They were both high-tempered,
and Marmaduke after an unusually fierce quarrel
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
left home and went to India. But have you
never heard the story of the Cromarty Fortune?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I never have. Is it a sad story? Would
you rather not tell me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, no; it isn&#8217;t a sad story, except that
the conditions are rather sad for us. But there&#8217;s
no reason in the world why you shouldn&#8217;t hear
it, if you care to. Indeed, I supposed Mabel
had already told it you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, she never did. Will you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. But not here. Let us go in, and get
the family all together, and we&#8217;ll give you a
dramatic recital of the Great Cromarty Mystery.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, is it a mystery story? How delightful.
I love a mystery.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you do, but I assure you I wish it
wasn&#8217;t a mystery.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will it never be solved?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I fear not, now. But let us go back to the
house, and tell the tale as it should be told.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They found that the others had already gone
into the house, and were gathered round the
big table that stood in the middle of the living
room. As they joined the group, Sinclair said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Before we play games this evening, we are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
going to tell Patty the story of Uncle Marmaduke&#8217;s
money.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty was surprised to note the different expressions
on her friends&#8217; faces. Mabel seemed
to shrink into herself, as if in embarrassment or
sensitiveness. Mrs. Cromarty looked calmly
proud, and Mrs. Hartley smiled a little.
</p>
<p>But Bob laughed outright, and said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good! I&#8217;ll help; we&#8217;ll all help, and we&#8217;ll
touch up the tale until it has all the dramatic
effect of a three-volume novel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t need touching up,&#8221; said Sinclair.
&#8220;Just the plain truth is story enough of itself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You begin it, Grandy,&#8221; said Bob, &#8220;and then,
when your imagination gives out, I&#8217;ll take a
hand at it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The old lady smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It needs no imagination, Robert,&#8221; she said;
&#8220;if Patty cares to hear of our family misfortune,
I&#8217;m quite willing to relate the tale.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I didn&#8217;t know it was a misfortune,&#8221; cried
Patty. &#8220;I thought it was a mystery story.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s both,&#8221; said Mrs. Cromarty, &#8220;but if the
mystery could be solved, it would be no misfortune.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds like an enigma,&#8221; observed
Patty.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all an enigma,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;Go ahead,
Grandy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The story begins,&#8221; said Mrs. Cromarty,
&#8220;with my marriage to Roger Cromarty. I was
wed in the year 1855. My husband and I were
happy during the first few years of our married
life. He was the owner of this beautiful place,
which had been in his family for many generations.
My daughter, Emmeline, was born here,
and when she was a child she filled the old house
with her happy laughter and chatter. My husband
had a brother, Marmaduke, with whom he
was not on good terms. Before my marriage,
this brother had left home, and gone to India.
My husband held no communication with him,
but we sometimes heard indirectly from him,
and reports always said that he was amassing
great wealth in some Indian commerce.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that his portrait?&#8221; asked Patty, indicating
a painting of a fine-looking man in the
prime of life.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mrs. Cromarty. &#8220;But the picture
represents him as looking amiable, whereas
he was always cross, grumpy, and irritable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Like me,&#8221; commented Bob.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said his mother, &#8220;I&#8217;m thankful to say
that none of you children show the slightest
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
signs of Uncle Marmaduke&#8217;s disposition. I was
only fifteen years old when he died, but I shall
never forget his scowling face and angry tones.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Was he always cross?&#8221; asked Patty, amazed
that any one could be invariably ill-tempered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Always,&#8221; said Mrs. Cromarty. &#8220;At least,
whenever he was here. I never saw him elsewhere.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go back, Grandy; you&#8217;re getting ahead of
your story.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I tried my best to bring about a
reconciliation between the two brothers, but both
were proud and a bit stubborn. I could not
persuade my husband to write to Marmaduke,
and though I wrote to him myself, my letters
were torn up, and the scraps returned to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lovely old gentleman!&#8221; commented Bob.
&#8220;I&#8217;m glad my manners are at least better than
that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;At last, my husband, Mr. Roger Cromarty,
became very ill. I knew he could not recover,
and wrote Marmaduke to that effect. To my
surprise, I received a grim, but fairly polite
letter, saying that he would leave India at once,
and hoped to reach his brother&#8217;s bedside in time
for a reconciliation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And did he?&#8221; asked Patty, breathlessly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but that was all. My husband was dying
when his brother came. They made peace,
however, and arranged some business matters.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; cried Patty, &#8220;how glad you must have
been that he did not come too late. What a
comfort all these years, to know that they did
make up their quarrel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed,&#8221; assented Mrs. Cromarty.
&#8220;But I have talked all I can. Emmeline, you
may take up the narrative.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell a little,&#8221; said Mrs. Hartley, smiling;
&#8220;but I shall soon let Sinclair continue. We
all know this tale by heart, but only Sinclair
can do full justice to the mysterious part
of it. I was only ten years old when my
father died, and Uncle Marmaduke came
here to live. It changed the whole world for
me. Where before all had been happiness and
love, now all was unkindness and fear. None
of us dared cross Uncle Marmaduke, for his
fiery anger was something not to be endured.
And beside being bad-tempered, he was erratic.
He did most peculiar things, without any reason
in them whatever. Altogether, he was a
most difficult man to live with. But at my
father&#8217;s death he owned this estate, and we had
to live with him or go homeless. He had plenty
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
of money, and he repaired and restored much
about the place. But even in this he was erratic.
He would have masons in to renew the
crumbling plaster and brickwork in the cellars,
while the drawing-room furniture could go ragged
and forlorn. He spent his money freely
for anything he wanted himself, but was niggardly
toward mother and myself. However,
he always told us that at his death we should
inherit his wealth. The estate, also, he willed
to mother. He lived with us for about five
years, and then was killed by a fall from his
horse. I was a girl of fifteen then, and when
he was brought in, mangled and almost dead,
he called for me. I went to his bedside, trembling,
for even then I feared he was going to
scold me. But he could only speak in hesitating,
disjointed sentences. It was with difficulty I
gathered that he was trying to give me some information
about his fortune. I wish now I had
tried to help him tell me; but at that time it
seemed heartless to think of such things when
the poor man was dying, and I soothed him, and
begged him not to try to talk, when it was such
an exertion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mother,&#8221; wailed Bob, &#8220;if you&#8217;d only
listened, instead of talking yourself!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></p>
<p>Mrs. Hartley smiled, as if she were used to
such comments at this part of the story.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I think Sinclair may take
up the recital here. That is, if you&#8217;re interested,
Patty?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;m interested! Indeed I am! It&#8217;s very
exciting, and I want it all now; no &#8216;continued in
our next.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know the end, ourselves,&#8221; said
Mabel, with such a wistful look in her eyes that
Patty went over and sat by her, and with her
arm round her listened to the rest of the story.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; said Sinclair, in his grave,
kindly voice, &#8220;Uncle Marmaduke tried very
hard to communicate to mother and Grandy
something about his fortune. But his accident
had somehow paralysed his throat, and he could
scarcely articulate. But for an hour or more,
as he lay dying, he would look at them with
piercing glances, and say what sounded like
dickens! gold!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he mean gold money?&#8221; asked Patty,
impulsively.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t know, then. But they thought
at the time that dickens! was one of his angry
expletives, as he was given to such language.
The gold, they felt sure, referred to his fortune,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
which he had always declared he would
leave to Grandmother. Then he died, without
being able to say any other except those two
words, gold and dickens.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He might have meant Charles Dickens,&#8221; suggested
Patty, who dearly loved to guess at a
puzzle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As it turned out, he did,&#8221; said Sinclair,
serenely; &#8220;but that&#8217;s ahead of the story.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And, too,&#8221; said Mrs. Hartley, &#8220;the way in
which he finally articulated the word, by a great
effort, and after many attempts, was so&mdash;so explosive,
that it sounded like an ejaculation far
more than like a noted author.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Years went by,&#8221; continued Sinclair, &#8220;and
Grandy and mother were left with the old Cromarty
estate, and nothing to keep it up with.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We had a small income, my boy,&#8221; said his
grandmother.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but not enough to keep the place as it
should be kept. However, no trace could be
found of Uncle Marmaduke&#8217;s money. He was
generally supposed to have brought a large fortune
home from India, but it seemed to have
vanished into thin air. His private papers and
belongings showed no records of stocks or
bonds, no bank books, and save for a small
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
amount of ready money he had by him, he
seemed to be penniless. Of course, he wasn&#8217;t;
the way he had lived, and the money he
had spent indicated that he had a fortune somewhere;
and, too, there was his promise to leave
it to Grandy. Of course, the conclusion was
that he had hidden this fortune.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A hidden fortune!&#8221; exclaimed Patty, blissfully.
&#8220;Oh, what a lovely mystery! Why, you
couldn&#8217;t have a better one!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think a discovered fortune would be far
better,&#8221; said Mabel, and Patty clasped her
friend&#8217;s hand in sympathy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;At last,&#8221; said Sinclair, &#8220;a <i>very</i> bright lawyer
had a glimmering of an idea that Uncle Marmaduke&#8217;s
last words had some meaning to them.
He inquired of the ladies of the house, and
learned that the late Mr. Marmaduke had been
exceedingly fond of reading Dickens, and that
he was greatly attached to his own well-worn
set of the great author&#8217;s works. &#8216;Ah, ha!&#8217; said
the very bright lawyer. &#8216;Between those well-thumbed
pages, we will find many Bank of England
notes, or certificates of valuable stocks!&#8217;
They flew to the library, and thoroughly
searched all the volumes of the set. And what
do you think they found?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; said Patty, wagging her head
solemnly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly that! Save for a book-marker here
and there, the volumes held nothing but their
own immortal stories. &#8216;Foiled again!&#8217; hissed
the <i>very</i> bright lawyer. But he kept right on
being foiled, and still no hoard of securities was
found.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what about the gold?&#8221; said Patty.
&#8220;They didn&#8217;t expect to find gold coins in
Dickens&#8217; books?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but they fondly hoped they&#8217;d find a
mysterious paper in cryptogram, like the &#8216;Gold
Bug,&#8217; you know, telling them to go out in the
dark of the moon, and dig north by northwest
under the old apple tree.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t try to be funny, Clair,&#8221; put in Bob;
&#8220;go on with the yarn. You&#8217;re telling it well
to-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And then,&#8221; said Sinclair, looking from one
to another of his interested hearers, &#8220;and then
the years rolled by until the fair maiden, Emmeline
Cromarty, was of sufficient age to have
suitors for her lily-white hand. As we can well
believe, after a mere glance in her direction, she
was the belle of the whole countryside. Brave
gallants from far and near came galloping into
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
the courtyard, and dismounting in feverish,
haste, cried, &#8216;What ho! is the radiant Emmeline
within?&#8217; Then the old warden with his
clanking keys admitted them, and they stood in
rows, that the coquettish damsel might make a
selection.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How ridiculous you are, Sinclair!&#8221; said his
mother, smiling. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you omit that part?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nay, nay, fair lady. And so, it came to
pass, that among the shoals of suitors was one
who was far more brave and strong and noble
than all the rest. Edgar Hartley&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sinclair&#8217;s voice broke a little as he spoke the
name of his revered father. But hiding his
emotion, he went on.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Edgar Hartley wooed and won Emmeline
Cromarty, and in the beautiful June of 1880
they were wed and merrily rang the bells. Now
while Edgar Hartley was by no means wealthy,
he had a fair income, and the fortunes of Cromarty
Manor improved. The young couple
took up their abode here, and the Dowager
Duchess of Cromarty lived with them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a Duchess,&#8221; interposed Mrs. Cromarty,
in her calm way.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to have been, Grandy,&#8221; declared
Bob. &#8220;You look the part, and I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
a missing title somewhere that belongs to you.
Perhaps Uncle Marmaduke concealed it with
the rest of his fortune.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, dear boy; we are not titled people. But
the Cromartys are an old family, and much beloved
and respected by all the country round.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are so!&#8221; declared Bob, with great enthusiasm.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>PUZZLING RHYMES</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;As I was saying,&#8221; continued Sinclair,
&#8220;Mr. and Mrs. Hartley lived happily
at Cromarty Manor. Three beautiful
children were born to them, who have since
grown to be the superior specimens of humanity
you see before you. I am the oldest, and, as I
may modestly remark, the flower of the family.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; commented Patty, looking
affectionately at Mabel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, anyway, as was only natural, the search
for that hidden fortune went on at times. Perhaps
a visitor would stir up the interest afresh,
and attempts would be made to discover new
meaning in Uncle Marmaduke&#8217;s last words.
And it was my father who succeeded in doing
this. He sat in the library one day, looking
over the old set of Dickens&#8217; works, which always
had a fascinating air of holding the secret.
He had not lived here long then, and was
not very familiar with the books on the library
shelves, but looking about he discovered another
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
set of Dickens, a much newer set, and the
volumes were bound in cloth, but almost entirely
covered by a gilded decoration. Wait,
I&#8217;ll show you one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sinclair rose, and going into the library, returned
in a moment with a copy of &#8220;Barnaby
Rudge.&#8221; It was bound in green cloth, but so
ornate was the gold tooling that little green
could be seen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dickens&mdash;gold&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; murmured Patty, her
eyes shining as she realised the new meaning in
the words.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; and, sure enough that was what Uncle
Marmaduke meant. Just think! For fifteen
years that set of books had stood untouched
on the shelves, while people nearly wore
out the older set, hunting for a clue to the
fortune!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s great!&#8221; declared Patty; &#8220;go on!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, this set of Dickens proved extremely
interesting. Between the leaves of the books
were papers of all sorts. Bills, deeds, banknotes,
memoranda, and even a will.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you had the fortune, at last?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No such luck. The banknotes and the few
securities in the books amounted to a fair
sum, which was gratefully appreciated by my
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
parents, but as to the bulk of the fortune,
it only made matters more tantalising than
ever.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked Patty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the papers was a will, properly executed
and witnessed, leaving all the fortune of
which Uncle Marmaduke died possessed, to my
mother. Then, instead of a definite statement
of where this money was deposited, were some
foolish jingles hinting where to find it. These
rhymes would be interesting as an old legend,
or in a story book, but to find them instead of
a heap of money, was, to say the least, disappointing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And did you never find the money?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never. And, of course, now we never will.
Remember all this happened twenty years ago.
I mean the discovery of the papers. Of course,
the money was hidden more than thirty-five
years ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And do you mean to say that you people
are living here, in your own house, and your
own money is hidden here somewhere, and you
can&#8217;t find it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly as you state it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well! <i>I&#8217;d</i> find it, if I had to tear the whole
house down.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a minute, Miss Impetuosity. We don&#8217;t
think it&#8217;s in the house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, out of doors?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re good at puzzles, I know, but just
wait until you hear the directions that came with
the package, and I think you&#8217;ll admit it&#8217;s a
hopeless problem.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;May she see them, Mother?&#8221; said Mabel.
&#8220;Will you get them out for us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not to-night, dear. I&#8217;ll show the old papers
to Patty, some other time; but now Sinclair can
tell her the lines just as well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of all the papers in the books,&#8221; Sinclair went
on, &#8220;only two seemed to be directions for finding
the money, although others vaguely hinted
that the fortune was concealed. And still others
gave the impression that Uncle Marmaduke
meant to tell mother all about it; but as his
death came upon him so suddenly, of course
he could not do this. On these two papers are
rhymes, which we children have known by heart
all our lives. One is:
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;&#8216;Great treasure lieth in the poke</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>Between the fir trees and the oak.&#8217;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>&#8220;You see uncle was a true poet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What does the poke mean?&#8221; asked Patty.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, a poke is a pocket; or a hiding-place of
any sort. Of course, this information sent
father to digging around every fir tree and oak
tree on the place. As you know, there are hundreds
of both kinds of trees, so the directions
can&#8217;t be called explicit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said Patty, wrinkling her brow, &#8220;it
says &#8216;between the fir trees and the oak,&#8217; as if
it meant a clump of firs and only one big oak.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; that&#8217;s what has been surmised. And
many a separate oak tree that stands near a
group of firs has been thoroughly investigated.
But wait; there&#8217;s another clue. On a separate
paper these words are written:
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;&#8216;Above the stair, across the hall,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 2em;'>Between the bedhead and the wall,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>A careful searching will reveal</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 2em;'>The noble fortune I conceal.&#8217;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>&#8220;There, could anything be plainer than
that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the money is <i>in</i> the house!&#8221; exclaimed
Patty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Take your choice. There are the two declarations.
It may be he concealed the money
in one place, and then transferred it to another.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
Or it may be he put part in the ground, and
part in the house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, &#8216;between the bedhead and the wall,&#8217; is
so definite. There are not so very many bedrooms,
you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;True enough. And of course, when my
father found that paper, he went directly upstairs,
crossed the hall, and so reached Uncle
Marmaduke&#8217;s own bedroom. The furniture
had been moved about, but Grandy remembered
where the head of the bed stood in Uncle&#8217;s
time. They searched thoroughly, took up flooring,
took down wainscoting, and all that, to no
avail.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, they tried other &#8216;bedheads&#8217;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, tell her about it, Grandy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mrs. Cromarty, placidly. &#8220;All
the bedrooms in the house, even the servants&#8217;
rooms, were subjected to most careful scrutiny.
Although so many years had elapsed, I could
remember where the various beds stood when
Marmaduke was with us. Behind each, we had
the walls sounded, and in some cases, broken
into. We even looked for pockets or receptacles
of some sort on the backs of the headboards
themselves, but never a trace of anything could
we find.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very exciting!&#8221; said Patty; &#8220;how can
you all be so calm about it? I should think
you&#8217;d be searching every minute!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must remember, dear,&#8221; said Mrs. Hartley,
&#8220;it&#8217;s an old story to us. At first, we were
indeed excited. For several years we searched
almost continuously. Then hope began to fail,
and our investigations became intermittent.
Every now and then we would make a fresh
attempt, but invariably repeated failures dampened
our enthusiasm.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s <i>so</i> interesting,&#8221; sighed Patty. &#8220;Can&#8217;t
we get up a little of the old enthusiasm, and
do some searching while I&#8217;m here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, we can,&#8221; cried Bob. &#8220;Would you
prefer an excavating party, with picks and
spades, or an indoor performance in the old
bedrooms?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Both,&#8221; declared Patty. &#8220;Of course I know
how absurd it is to go over the ground that
has already been worn threadbare, but&mdash;but,
oh! if we <i>could</i> find it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Grandma Cromarty smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Forgive me, dearie,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but I&#8217;ve
heard those sentiments from all my guests to
whom we have told the story, for the past
thirty-five years; and though I don&#8217;t want to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
seem ungrateful for your interest, I feel it my
duty to warn you there is no hope.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes there is <i>hope</i>, Grandy,&#8221; said Sinclair,
&#8220;but there is nothing else. There&#8217;s no
probability, scarcely a possibility, but we&#8217;ll <i>never</i>
give up hope.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never!&#8221; agreed Bob; but Mabel&#8217;s expression
plainly showed that she hadn&#8217;t the faintest
glimmering of a hope.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It does seem so strange,&#8221; said Patty, thoughtfully,
&#8220;to have the two directions, and both so
explicit. No, not explicit, they&#8217;re not that, but
both so definite.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hardly definite, either,&#8221; said Bob, &#8220;except
that they seem to reveal the fact that there <i>is</i> a
fortune concealed about the place. Oh! it
makes me frantic! I feel so helpless.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no use storming about it, Bob, my
boy,&#8221; said his mother. &#8220;And, Patty, you
mustn&#8217;t set us down as too mercenary in this
matter. But I think you know that we, as a
family, long for the means which would enable
us to keep up this dear old place as it should
be, and not let its beautiful parks and gardens
go uncared for and neglected.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do know!&#8221; cried Patty; &#8220;and it makes me
furious to think that the money&mdash;your own
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
money&mdash;is perhaps within your reach, and yet&mdash;you
can&#8217;t get it! Oh, why didn&#8217;t Mr. Marmaduke
say just where he put it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He did,&#8221; said Bob, smiling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, so he did. Well, I&#8217;d tear up every
square foot of ground on the whole estate,
then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember, Patty,&#8221; said Sinclair, in his quiet
way, &#8220;there are nearly ten thousand acres in
all; and except for meadowlands and water,
there are oaks and firs on nearly every acre.
The fortune itself would scarcely pay for all
that labour.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, I&#8217;d tear the house to pieces.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no you wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Mrs. Hartley;
&#8220;and beside, that has almost been done. My
husband had so much of the woodwork and
plaster removed, that I almost feared he
would bring the house down about our ears.
And it is such a big, rambling old place,
it is hopeless to think of examining it really
thoroughly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty glanced around at the great hall she was
in. The groined ceiling, with its intricate carvings
at the intersections; the cornice carved in
deep relief, with heraldic bosses, and massive
patterns; the tall columns and pilasters; all
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
seemed part of an old monument which it would
be desecration to break into.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder where it is,&#8221; she said; &#8220;indoors
or out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s out of doors,&#8221; said Sinclair. &#8220;I
think uncle hid it in the house first, and then
wrote his exquisite poem about the poke. Perhaps
it was merely a pocket of leather or canvas,
that hung behind the headboard of his own
bed. In that case all prying into the walls would
mean nothing. Then, I think, as that was only
a temporary hiding-place, he later buried it in
the ground between some special oak tree and
fir tree, or trees. I think, too, he left, or meant
to leave some more of his poetry to tell which
trees, but owing to his sudden taking off, he
didn&#8217;t do this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sinclair,&#8221; said Bob, &#8220;as our American friend,
Mr. Dooley, says, &#8216;Yer opinions is inthrestin&#8217;,
but not convincin&#8217;.&#8217; As opinions, they&#8217;re fine;
but I wish I had some facts. If uncle had only
left a cryptogram or a cipher, I&#8217;d like it better
than all that rhymed foolishness.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps it isn&#8217;t foolishness,&#8221; said Patty; &#8220;I
think, with Sinclair, it&#8217;s likely Mr. Marmaduke
wrote the indoor one first, and then changed
the hiding-place and wrote the other. But how
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
could he do all this hiding and rehiding without
being seen?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I went up to London every season,&#8221; said
Mrs. Cromarty; &#8220;and, of course, took Emmeline
with me. Marmaduke always stayed
here, and thus had ample opportunity to do
what he would. Indeed, he usually had great
goings-on while we were away. One year, he
had the Italian garden laid out. Another year,
he had a new porter&#8217;s lodge built. This was
done the last year of his life, and as he had
masons around so much at that time, repairing
the cellars and all that, we thought later, that he
might have had a hiding-place arranged in the
wall behind the head of his bed. But, if so, we
never could find it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And have you dug under the trees much?&#8221;
persisted Patty, who could not accept the hopelessness
of the others.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dug!&#8221; exclaimed Bob, &#8220;I&#8217;ve blistered my
hands by the hour. I&#8217;ve viewed fir trees and
oaks, until I know every one on the place by
heart. I&#8217;ve trudged a line from oaks to firs,
and starting in the middle, I&#8217;ve dug both ways.
But I&#8217;m nearly ready to give up. Not quite,
though. I&#8217;m making a thorough search of all
the books in the library, on the chance of finding
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
some other message. But there are such a
lot of books! I&#8217;ve been at it for three years
now, off and on, and I&#8217;m only three-quarters
way round. And not a paper yet, except a few
old letters and bills.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll help you, Bob,&#8221; said Patty; &#8220;oh, I&#8217;d love
to do something toward the search, even if I
don&#8217;t find a thing. I&#8217;ll begin to-morrow. You
tell me what books you&#8217;ve done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will, indeed. I&#8217;ll be jolly glad to have
help. And you can do as much as you
like, before your young enthusiasm wears
off.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it, gladly,&#8221; said Patty, and then they
discovered that the evening had flown away,
and it was bedtime.
</p>
<p>As they went upstairs, Mabel followed Patty
to her room and sat down for a little good-night
chat.
</p>
<p>Patty&#8217;s eyes were shining with excitement, and
as she took off her hair ribbon, and folded it
round her hand, she said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if we don&#8217;t find anything, you&#8217;ll be no
worse off, and it&#8217;s such fun to hunt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t tell you all, Patty,&#8221; said Mabel,
in a pathetic tone, and Patty turned quickly to
her friend.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why, what do you mean?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean this. Of course, we&#8217;ve never been
rich, and we&#8217;ve never been able to do for the
place what ought to be done for it; but we have
been able to live here. And now&mdash;now, if we
can&#8217;t get any more money, we&mdash;we can&#8217;t stay
here! Oh, Patty!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty&#8217;s arms went round Mabel, as the poor
child burst into tears.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, sobbing, &#8220;some of mother&#8217;s
business interests have failed&mdash;it&#8217;s all come on
lately, I don&#8217;t entirely understand it&mdash;but, anyway,
we may soon have to leave Cromarty, and
oh, Patty, how <i>could</i> we live anywhere else? and
what&#8217;s worse, how <i>could</i> we have any one else
living here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave Cromarty Manor! Where you&#8217;ve all
lived so long&mdash;I mean your ancestors and all!
Why, Mabel, you can&#8217;t do that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But we&#8217;ll have to. We haven&#8217;t money
enough to pay the servants&mdash;or, at least, we
won&#8217;t have, soon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure of all this, dear? Does Mrs.
Cromarty expect to go away?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all uncertain. We don&#8217;t know. But
mother&#8217;s lawyer thinks we&#8217;d better sell or let
the place. Of course we won&#8217;t sell it, but it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
would be almost as bad to let it. Think of
strangers here!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t think of such a thing! It seems impossible.
But perhaps matters may turn out
better than you think. Perhaps you won&#8217;t have
to go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what Sinclair says&mdash;and mother. But
I&#8217;m sure the worst will happen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Mabel, stop that! I won&#8217;t let you
look on the dark side. And, anyway, you&#8217;re not
to think any more about it to-night. You won&#8217;t
sleep a wink if you get nervous and worried.
Now put it out of your mind, and let&#8217;s talk
about the croquet party to-morrow at Grace
Meredith&#8217;s. How are we going over?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You and I are to drive in the pony cart, and
the others will go in the carriage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That will be lovely. Now, what shall we
wear?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Thus, tactfully, Patty led Mabel&#8217;s thoughts
away from her troubles, for the time, at least,
and when the two friends parted for the night,
they both went healthily and happily to sleep.

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>THE CROQUET PARTY</h3>
</div>

<p>The next afternoon the two girls started
in the pony cart for the Merediths.
</p>
<p>Patty loved to play croquet, and though
it greatly amused her to hear the English people
pronounce the word as if it were spelled <i>croky</i>,
yet not to appear peculiar, she spoke it that way
too.
</p>
<p>The party was a large one, and the games were
arranged somewhat after the fashion of a tournament.
</p>
<p>Patty&#8217;s partner was Tom Meredith, and as he
played a fairly good game they easily beat their
first opponents.
</p>
<p>But later on they found themselves matched
against Mabel Hartley and a young man named
Jack Stanton. Mr. Stanton was an expert, and
Mabel played the best game Patty had ever seen
a girl play.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no use,&#8221; said Patty, good-naturedly, as
they began the game, &#8220;Tom and I never can
win against you two.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t despair,&#8221; said Tom, encouragingly,
&#8220;There&#8217;s many a slip, you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The game progressed until, when Tom and
Patty were about three-quarters of the way
around, Mabel was passing through her last
wicket and Mr. Stanton was a &#8220;rover.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Be careful, now,&#8221; said Mr. Stanton, as
Mabel aimed to send her ball through the arch.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a straight shot, and a long shot, and
you&#8217;re liable to touch the post.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s just what happened. As Mabel&#8217;s
swift, clear stroke sent the ball straight through
the wicket, it went spinning on and hit squarely
the home stake.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jupiter! that&#8217;s bad luck!&#8221; exclaimed Jack
Stanton. &#8220;They&#8217;ll jolly well beat us now. But
never mind, perhaps I can slip through yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But he couldn&#8217;t. The fact that they had two
plays to his one, gave Patty and Tom a great
advantage.
</p>
<p>Tom was a clever manager, and Patty followed
his directions implicitly. So they played
a defensive game, and spent much time keeping
Stanton&#8217;s ball away from the positions he desired.
The result was that Tom and Patty won,
but their success was really owing to Mabel&#8217;s
mistake in going out.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span></p>
<p>The test was to win two games out of three,
so with one game in favor of Patty&#8217;s side they
began the next.
</p>
<p>Patty was considered a good croquet player in
America, but in England the rules of the game,
as well as the implements, were so different that
it seriously impeded her progress.
</p>
<p>The wickets were so narrow that the ball could
barely squeeze through if aimed straight, and
a side shot through one was impossible.
</p>
<p>But all this added to the zest, and it was four
very eager young people who strove for the
victory.
</p>
<p>The second game went easily to Mabel and
Jack Stanton, and then the third, the decisive
one, was begun. According to the laws of the
tournament, this was the final game. The opponents
had already vanquished all the other
contestants, and now, pitted against each other,
were playing for the prize.
</p>
<p>Patty knew in her heart she would be glad to
have Mabel win it, and yet, so strong was her
love of games, and so enthusiastic her natural
desire to succeed, that she tried her best to beat
the third game.
</p>
<p>All played conservatively. The partners kept
together, and progressed evenly. Toward the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
last Jack and Mabel began to creep ahead.
Tom saw this, and said to Patty: &#8220;This is our
last chance; if we plod on like this, they&#8217;ll calmly
walk out and leave us. Unless we can make a
brilliant dash of some sort, we are beaten.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe I can,&#8221; said Patty, looking
doubtfully at her ball. &#8220;It&#8217;s my turn, and unless
I can hit Mabel&#8217;s ball, clear across the
grounds, I can&#8217;t do anything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just it. You <i>must</i> hit Mabel&#8217;s ball.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So Patty aimed carefully, and sent her ball
spinning over the ground toward Mabel&#8217;s, and
missed it by a hair&#8217;s breadth!
</p>
<p>&#8220;Goody!&#8221; cried Mabel, and hitting Patty&#8217;s
ball, she roqueted it back where it had come
from.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now here&#8217;s our very lastest chance,&#8221; said
Tom, with a groan of despair. &#8220;And I&#8217;m sure,
Patty, I won&#8217;t do any better than you did.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nor did he. Although not far from Jack&#8217;s
ball, at which he aimed, there was a wicket in
the way, which sent his own ball glancing off at
an angle, and he did not hit his opponent.
</p>
<p>A minute more, and Jack skilfully sent Mabel&#8217;s
ball and then his own against the home stake,
and the game was over.
</p>
<p>The onlookers crowded up and congratulated
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
the winners, and offered condolence to Patty and
Tom. Patty smiled, and responded merrily.
She did not try to lay the blame on the unusual
shaped wickets, or short, heavy mallets. She
declared that the best players had won, and
that she was satisfied. And indeed she was.
</p>
<p>When she saw the lovely prize that was given
to Mabel, she was deeply thankful that she
hadn&#8217;t won it. It was a white parasol, of silk
and chiffon, with a pearl handle. A really exquisite,
dainty affair, and just the very thing
Mabel had wanted, but couldn&#8217;t afford to buy.
As for Patty herself, she had several parasols,
and so was delighted that Mabel had won.
</p>
<p>But though she truly preferred that Mabel
should have the prize, she felt a little chagrined
at losing the contest, for like all people who are
fond of games and sports, Patty loved to win.
</p>
<p>These feelings, though, she successfully concealed,
and gave Mabel very sincere and loving
congratulations. Mr. Stanton&#8217;s prize was a
pretty scarf pin, and Tom Meredith loudly bewailed
his own misfortune in losing this.
Though, really, as the tournament was at his
own home, he would not have taken the prize
had he won it, but would have passed it on to
the one with the next highest record.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span></p>
<p>The victors were cheered and applauded, and
were then led in triumph to the pretty tent where
tea was being served.
</p>
<p>If Patty had had a shadow of regret that she
had not been the honoured one, it was lost sight
of in her gladness that it fell to Mabel&#8217;s lot.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a plucky one,&#8221; said Tom Meredith,
who was observing her closely. &#8220;You&#8217;re a
good loser, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Patty, thoughtfully.
&#8220;I want to be, but do you know, I just love to
win contests or games. And when I lose&mdash;I&#8217;m
ashamed to say it&mdash;but I do feel put out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you do! That&#8217;s only natural.
And that&#8217;s why I say you&#8217;re a good loser. If
you didn&#8217;t care tuppence whether you won or
not, it wouldn&#8217;t be much to your credit to look
smiling and pleasant when you lose. But since
you <i>do</i> care, a whole lot, you&#8217;re a jolly plucky
girl to take it so well. Now, what can I get
for you? An ice?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, please,&#8221; said Patty, really gratified at
Tom&#8217;s appreciative words.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How long are you staying with the Hartleys?&#8221;
Tom asked, as, returning with ices, he
found cosy seats at a small table for himself
and Patty.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Two or three weeks longer, I think. But
I shall hate to go away, for I&#8217;ve become so interested
in their &#8216;mystery,&#8217; that I can&#8217;t stop
trying to solve it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you mean that old affair of the hidden
fortune. I don&#8217;t believe there&#8217;s any at all. I
think the old man who pretended to hide it was
merely guying them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no! That can&#8217;t be. Why, it all sounds
so real and natural. The story of the hiding,
I mean.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but why should he want to hide it?
Why not bank it decently, like other people?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, because he was eccentric. People who
are naturally queer or freakish are always hiding
things. And I know it&#8217;s silly of me, but I&#8217;m
going to try to find that money.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve lots of faith in your energy and perseverance,
but I can&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll succeed in
that job. Better try something easier.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I can say I expect to succeed.
But I&#8217;m going to try&mdash;and&mdash;who can tell what
might happen?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who, indeed? But you know, of course,
that the Cromarty people have been hunting it
for nearly forty years.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Patty, and her eyes fairly blazed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
with determination, &#8220;yes&mdash;but I am an
American!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom Meredith shouted with laughter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good for you, little Stars and Stripes!&#8221; he
cried. &#8220;I&#8217;ve always heard of the cleverness of
the Yankees, but if you can trace the Cromarty
fortune, I&#8217;ll believe you a witch, for sure.
Aren&#8217;t there witches in that New England of
yours?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe there used to be. And my ancestors,
some of them, were Salem people.
That may be where I get my taste for divination
and solving problems. I just love
puzzles of all sorts, and if the old Cromarty
gentleman had only left a cipher message, it
would have been fun to puzzle it out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He did leave messages of some sort, didn&#8217;t
he? Maybe they are more subtle than you
think.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been wondering about that. They
might mean something entirely different from
what they sound like; but I can&#8217;t see any light
that way. &#8216;The headboard of a bed against a
wall,&#8217; is pretty practical, and doesn&#8217;t seem to
mean anything else. And the oak trees and fir
trees are there in abundance. But that&#8217;s the
trouble with them, there are so many.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Go on, and do all you can, my child. You&#8217;ll
get over it the sooner, if you work hard on it
at first. We&#8217;ve all been through it. Nearly
everybody in this part of the country has tried
at one time or another to guess the Cromarty
riddle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m the first American to try,&#8221; insisted
Patty, with a twinkle in her eye.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite so, Miss Yankee Doodle Doo; and I
wish you success where my own countrymen
have failed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom said this with such a nice, kindly air that
Patty felt a little ashamed of her own vaunting
attitude. But sometimes Patty showed a decided
tendency to over-assuredness in her own
powers, and though she tried to correct it, it
would spring up now and again. Then the
Hartley boys joined them, and all discussion
of the missing fortune was dropped.
</p>
<p>It was soon time to take leave, and as it was
already twilight, Sinclair proposed that he
should drive Patty home in the pony cart, and
Mabel should return in the carriage.
</p>
<p>Mabel quite agreed to this, saying that after
her croquet, she did not care to drive. The
road lay through a lovely bit of country, and
Patty enjoyed the drive home with Sinclair.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
She always liked to talk with him, he was so
gentle and kindly. While not so merry as Bob
or as Tom Meredith, Sinclair was an interesting
talker, and Patty always felt that she was
benefited by his conversation.
</p>
<p>He told her much about the country as they
drove along, described the life and work of the
villagers, and pointed out buildings or other
objects of interest.
</p>
<p>They passed several fine estates, whose towering
mansions could be seen half hidden by trees,
or boldly placed on a summit.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But no place is as beautiful as Cromarty,&#8221;
said Sinclair, and Patty entirely agreed with
them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it true that you may have to leave it?&#8221;
she asked, thinking it wiser to refer to it casually.
</p>
<p>Sinclair frowned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s been talking to you?&#8221; he said;
&#8220;Mabel, I suppose. Well, yes, there is a chance
that we&#8217;ll have to let it for a term of years. I
hope not, but I can&#8217;t tell yet. But even if so,
it will be only temporary. As soon as I get
fairly established in my career, I hope to make
money enough to take care of it all. A few
years hence, when I&#8217;m on my feet, and Bob&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
through college, it will be easier all round. But
if some business troubles that are now impending
don&#8217;t blow over, there&#8217;ll be no income to
keep things going, and we&#8217;ll have to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;But
that <i>shan&#8217;t</i> happen!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sinclair spoke almost desperately, and Patty
saw his fingers clench around the reins he was
holding.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; said Patty slowly, for she was
not quite sure how what she was about to say
would be received. &#8220;I wonder, Sinclair, if
we&#8217;re not good friends enough, you and I, for
me to speak plainly to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The young man gave her a quick, earnest
glance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; he said, briefly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only this,&#8221; said Patty, still hesitating,
&#8220;my father has lots of money&mdash;couldn&#8217;t you&mdash;couldn&#8217;t
he lend you some?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sinclair looked at her squarely now, and spoke
in low, stern tones.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never suggest such a thing again. The Cromartys
do not borrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not even from a friend?&#8221; said Patty, softly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not even from a friend,&#8221; repeated Sinclair,
but his voice was more gentle. &#8220;You don&#8217;t understand,
I suppose,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;but we would
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
leave Cromarty for ever before we would stay
on such terms.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Patty, &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand. I
should think you&#8217;d be as glad to accept a friend&#8217;s
help as he would be to offer it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;d do me a real kindness, Patty, you&#8217;ll
never even mention such an idea again. I know
you mean well and I thank you, but it&#8217;s absolutely
impossible.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then there&#8217;s only one other way out of the
difficulty,&#8221; said Patty, with an effort at lightness;
&#8220;and that&#8217;s to find your buried fortune.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, that would be a help,&#8221; cried Sinclair,
also assuming a gayer tone. &#8220;If you&#8217;ll help us
to do that, I&#8217;ll set up a memorial tablet to your
cleverness.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where will you set it? Between the fir trees
and the oak?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, if you find the fortune there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But if I find it behind the headboard, that&#8217;s
no sort of a place for a tablet!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can choose your own spot for your Roll
of Fame, and I&#8217;ll see to it that the memorial is a
worthy one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And will you put fresh flowers on it every
day?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed; for if&mdash;I mean <i>when</i>, you find
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
the fortune for us, the gardens will have immediate
attention.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I must set to work at once,&#8221; said Patty,
with pretended gravity, but in her heart she
registered a mental vow to try in earnest to
fulfil the promise given in jest.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>THE GRIFFIN AND THE ROSE</h3>
</div>

<p>Although the Hartleys had practically
given up all hope of ever finding the
hidden money, they couldn&#8217;t help being
imbued with Patty&#8217;s enthusiasm.
</p>
<p>Indeed, it took little to rouse the sleeping fires
of interest that never were entirely extinguished.
</p>
<p>But though they talked it over by the hour
there seemed to be nothing to do but talk.
</p>
<p>One day, Patty went out all by herself, determined
to see if she couldn&#8217;t find some combination
of an oak tree and a group of firs that
would somehow seem especially prominent.
</p>
<p>But after looking at a score or more of
such combinations, she realised that task was
futile.
</p>
<p>She looked at the ground under some of them,
but who could expect a mark of any kind on
the ground after nearly forty years? No. Unless
Mr. Marmaduke Cromarty had marked his
hiding-place with a stone or iron plate, it would
probably never be found by his heirs. Search
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
in the house was equally unsatisfactory. What
availed it to scan a wall or a bedstead that had
been scrutinised for years by eager, anxious
eyes? And then Patty set her wits to work.
She tried to think where an erratic old gentleman
would secrete his wealth. And she was
forced to admit that the most natural place was
in the ground on his estate, the location to be
designated by some obscure message. And
surely, the message was obscure enough!
</p>
<p>She kept her promise to help Bob in his self-appointed
task of going through all the books
in the library. This was no small piece of work,
for it was not enough to shake each book, and
let loose papers, if any, drop out. Some of the
old papers had been found pinned to leaves, and
so each book must be run through in such a
way that every page could be glanced at.
</p>
<p>Nor was this a particularly pleasant task. For
Mrs. Hartley had made it a rule that when her
own children went over the old books, they were
to dust them as they went along. Thus, she
said, at least some good would be accomplished,
though no hidden documents might be found.
</p>
<p>Of course, she did not request Patty to do
this, but learning of the custom, Patty insisted
on doing it, and many an hour she spent in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
old library, clad in apron and dust-cap. Her
progress was rather slow, for book-loving Patty
often became absorbed in the old volumes, and
dropping down on the window-seat, or the old
steps to the gallery, would read away, oblivious
to all else till some one came to hunt for
her.
</p>
<p>At last, one day, her patient search met a reward.
In an old book she found several of
what were beyond all doubt Mr. Marmaduke
Comarty&#8217;s papers.
</p>
<p>Without looking at them closely, Patty took
the book straight to Mrs. Cromarty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me!&#8221; said the old lady, putting on her
glasses. &#8220;Have we really found something?
I declare I&#8217;m quite nervous over it. Emmeline,
you read them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hartley was a bit excited, too, and as
for Patty and Mabel, they nearly went frantic
at their elders&#8217; slowness in opening the old and
yellow papers.
</p>
<p>There were several letters, a few bills, and
some hastily-scribbled memoranda. The letters
and bills were of no special interest, but on one
of the small bits of paper was another rhymed
couplet that seemed to indicate a direction.
</p>
<p>It read:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span></p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;Where the angry griffin shows,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>Ruthless, tear away the rose.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; exclaimed Patty, &#8220;it&#8217;s another direction
how to get the fortune! Oh, Mabel, it
will be all right yet! Oh, where is the
angry griffin? Is it over a rosebush? You&#8217;re
only to pull up the rosebush, and there you
are!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mabel looked bewildered. So did the older
ladies.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Speak, somebody!&#8221; cried Patty, dancing
about in excitement. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t there any angry
griffin? There must be!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the trouble,&#8221; said Mrs. Hartley;
&#8220;there are so many of them. Why, there are
angry griffins on the gates, over the lodge doors,
on the marbles in the gardens, and all over the
house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course there are,&#8221; said Mabel. &#8220;You
must have noticed them, Patty. There&#8217;s one
now,&#8221; and she pointed to a bit of wood carving
over the door frame of the room they were in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care! It means something, I know
it does,&#8221; declared Patty. &#8220;We&#8217;ll work it out
yet. I wish the boys were home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll soon be here,&#8221; said Mrs. Cromarty.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
&#8220;I can&#8217;t help thinking that it does mean something&mdash;Marmaduke
was very fond of roses, and
it would be just like him to plant a rosebush
over his buried treasure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; cried Patty. &#8220;Now, where is
there a rosebush growing, and one of the angry
griffins near it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There probably are some in the rose garden,&#8221;
said Mrs. Cromarty. &#8220;I don&#8217;t remember
any, though.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, Mabel,&#8221; said Patty, &#8220;let&#8217;s go and
look. I can&#8217;t wait another minute!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Away flew the two girls, and for the next hour
they hovered about the rosebushes with more
energy than is often shown by the busiest of
bees.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish old Uncle Marmaduke had been less
of a poet,&#8221; said Mabel, as they sat down a
moment to rest, &#8220;and more of a&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;More straightforward,&#8221; suggested Patty.
&#8220;If he&#8217;d only written a few words of plain
prose, and left it with his lawyer, all this trouble
needn&#8217;t have been.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose he did intend to make it
plain before he died, but he went off so suddenly.
Oh, here are the boys.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sinclair and Bob came bounding down toward
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
the rose garden, followed more sedately by their
mother and grandmother.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a sign of a griffin a-sniffin&#8217; of a rose,&#8221;
said Patty, disconsolately.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you haven&#8217;t looked all round yet,&#8221; said
Bob. &#8220;It&#8217;s such fun to have something to look
for besides fir trees and beds, I&#8217;m going to make
a close search.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Sinclair, &#8220;the same rose
bush wouldn&#8217;t be here now that was here thirty
or forty years ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But it would have been renewed,&#8221; said Mrs.
Cromarty. &#8220;We&#8217;ve always tried to keep the
flowers as nearly as possible the same.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then here goes to interview every griffin on
the place,&#8221; declared Bob. &#8220;Jolly of old uncle
to mark the spot with a rosebush and a griffin.
That&#8217;s what I call decent of him. And you&#8217;re a
wonder, Patty, to find the old paper.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s nothing,&#8221; said Patty. &#8220;I just followed
your orders about the books. If you&#8217;d
kept at it yourself, you&#8217;d have found the same
book.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose so. But I&#8217;m glad you helped the
good work along. Oh, dear! no rosebush
seems to be near a griffin; and the griffins seem
positively afraid of the rosebushes.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
And try as they would, no angry griffin could
they find, with a rosebush near it. Griffins there
were in plenty; both angry and grinning. Also
were there plenty of roses, but they were arranged
in well-laid-out beds, and in no case
were guarded or menaced by angry griffins.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; said Sinclair, as they returned
to the house for dinner, &#8220;it&#8217;s something to work
on. I shall stay at home to-morrow and try to
find that particular rosebush, or the place where
it used to be.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s a stone rose,&#8221; said Patty, as she
touched a rose carved in stone that was part of
an ornamental urn whose handles were the
heads of angry griffins. Sinclair stared at her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right,&#8221; he said, slowly, as if grasping
a great thought. &#8220;It&#8217;s much more likely
to be a rose of stone or marble, and when that&#8217;s
ruthlessly torn away the secret will be revealed.
Oh, mother, there <i>is</i> hope!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty had never seen the placid Sinclair so excited,
and they all went to their rooms to get
ready for dinner, with a feeling that something
was going to happen. Conversation at dinner
was all on the engrossing subject.
</p>
<p>Everybody made suggestions, and everybody
recalled various partly-forgotten griffins in odd
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
nooks and corners, each being sure that was
&#8220;just the place uncle would choose!&#8221;
</p>
<p>After dinner, the young people were anxious to
go out and search more, but it had begun to
rain, so they all went into the library and again
scrutinised the old papers Patty had found.
</p>
<p>They looked through more books, too, but
found nothing further of interest.
</p>
<p>At last, wearied with the hunt, Patty threw
herself into a big armchair and declared she
would do no more that night.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say not,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;You&#8217;ve done
quite enough in giving us this new start.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Although, as Patty had said, the looking
through all the old books was Bob&#8217;s plan, he
generously gave her the credit of this new find.
Sinclair threw himself on a long leather couch,
and began to sing softly some of their nonsense
songs, as he often did when tired out. The
others joined, and for a time the fortune was
left to take care of itself.
</p>
<p>Very pleasant were the four fresh young
voices, and the elders listened gladly to their
music.
</p>
<p>In the middle of a song, Patty stopped, and
sat bolt upright, her eyes staring at a door
opposite her as if she had never seen it before.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Gracious, goodness! Patty,&#8221; said Mabel,
&#8220;what is the matter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, little one?&#8221; said Sinclair,
still humming the refrain of the interrupted
song.
</p>
<p>Patty pointed to the door, or rather to the
elaborately carved door frame, and said slowly,
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been reading a lot in the old architecture
books&mdash;and they often used to have secret hiding
places in the walls. And look at that door
frame! There&#8217;s an angry griffin on one jamb,
and a smiling griffin on the other, and under
each is a rose. That is it&#8217;s a five-leafed blossom,
a sort of conventional flower that they always
call a rose in architecture.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Though I suppose,&#8221; said Sinclair, &#8220;by any
other name it would look as sweet. Patty, my
child, you&#8217;re dreaming. That old carving is as
solid as Gibraltar and that old griffin isn&#8217;t very
angry anyway. He just looks rather purse
proud and haughty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s the only griffin that&#8217;s near a rose,&#8221;
persisted Patty. &#8220;And he is angry, compared
to the happy-looking griffin opposite to him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe the girl is right,&#8221; said Bob, who was
already examining the carvings in question.
&#8220;The rose doesn&#8217;t look movable, exactly, but it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
is not quite like this other rose. It&#8217;s more deeply
cut.&#8221;
</p>
<p>By this time all had clustered about the door
frame, and one after another poked and pushed
at the wooden rose.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something in it,&#8221; persisted Bob.
&#8220;In the idea, I mean. If there&#8217;s a secret hiding-place
in that upright carved beam, that rose
is the key to it. See how deeply it&#8217;s cut in, compared
to the other; and I can almost see a crack
all round it, as if it could be removed. May
I try to get it out, Grandy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, my boy. We mustn&#8217;t leave a stone
unturned.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A rose unturned, you mean. Clair, what
shall we ruthlessly tear it away with? I hate
to take a chisel to this beautiful old door.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Try a corkscrew,&#8221; said Mabel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean a gimlet,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;That&#8217;s a
good idea.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Fetching a gimlet, he bored a hole right in the
centre of the carved blossom, but though it
turned and creaked a little it wouldn&#8217;t come
out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It must come,&#8221; said Sinclair. &#8220;It turns, so
that proves it&#8217;s meant to be movable. It probably
has some hinge or spring that is rusted, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
so it doesn&#8217;t work as it ought to. We&#8217;ll have
to take hammer and chisel; shall we, Grandy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boys were deferential to Mrs. Cromarty,
for they well knew that she was tired of having
the old house torn up to no avail. But surely
this was an important development.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed, boys. If your uncle&#8217;s words
mean anything, they mean that it must be ruthlessly
torn away, if removed at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For quite ten minutes the two boys worked
away with their tools, endeavouring to mar the
carving as little as might be, but resolved to
succeed in their undertaking. At last the
wooden rose fell out in their hands, leaving a
round opening.
</p>
<p>Peering in, Sinclair saw a small iron knob,
which seemed to be part of a rusty spring.
</p>
<p>Greatly excited, he tried to push or turn it, but
couldn&#8217;t move it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway, we&#8217;re getting warm,&#8221; he cried, and
his glowing face corroborated his words.
</p>
<p>The boys took turns in working at the stubborn
spring, trying with forceps and pincers to move
it, until at last something seemed to give way,
and the whole front of the door jamb fell out
as one panel.
</p>
<p>Behind it was a series of small pigeon holes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
one above the other, all filled with neatly piled
papers.
</p>
<p>Though yellow with age, the papers were carefully
folded, labelled, and dated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty!&#8221; cried Mabel, as she embraced her
friend, &#8220;you&#8217;ve found our fortune for us!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be too sure,&#8221; said Patty, laughing, and
almost crying at the same time, so excited was
she. &#8220;Your Uncle Marmaduke was of such
uncertain ways I shouldn&#8217;t wonder if these
were merely more files of his immortal verse.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re bills,&#8221; declared Sinclair, as he ran
over a packet he took from a shelf.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s look them all over systematically,&#8221; said
Bob. &#8220;Let&#8217;s all sit round the table, and one of
us read out what the paper is about. Then if
we come to anything important, we&#8217;ll all know
it at once.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This plan was adopted, and Sinclair, as the
oldest, was chosen to read. He sat at the head
of the long library table, and the others were at
either side.
</p>
<p>But the packets of bills, though interesting in
a general way, had no bearing on the great
question of the fortune. The papers were all
bills.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not even a bit of poetry,&#8221; sighed Patty, as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
Sinclair laid aside one after another of the receipted
bills for merchandise, household goods,
clothing, and labour.
</p>
<p>&#8220;These might interest a historian,&#8221; said Sinclair,
&#8220;as they throw some light on the prices of
goods at that time. But we&#8217;ll keep on, we may
come to something of interest yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;I&#8217;m so anxious,
that nothing less than a straight direction to the
fortune would satisfy me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, here&#8217;s something,&#8221; said Sinclair,
&#8220;whatever it may mean.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The paper he had just unfolded was a mason&#8217;s
bill, containing only one item. The bill was
made out in due form, by one Martin Campbell,
and was properly receipted as paid. And its
single item read:
</p>
<p>&#8220;To constructing one secret pocket....
Three Guineas.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; cried Patty, breathless with excitement.
&#8220;Then there is a secret pocket, or poke
as your exasperating uncle calls it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There must be,&#8221; said Sinclair; &#8220;and now
that we know that, we&#8217;re going to find it. Of
course, we assumed there was one, but we had
only that foolish doggerel to prove it. Now
this regular bill establishes it as a fact beyond
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
all doubt. Do you know this Martin Campbell,
Grandy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know there was a mason by that name, who
worked here several times for your uncle. He
came down from Leicester, but of course I
know nothing more of him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll find him!&#8221; declared Bob. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
make him give up the secret of the pocket.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he&#8217;s dead by this time,&#8221; said Sinclair.
&#8220;Was he an old man, Grandy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, my dear. I never saw him.
He worked here when I was away in London.
I fear, however, he is not alive now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, perhaps he is. It was only about thirty-five
years ago, or forty, that he built this &#8216;secret
pocket.&#8217; Thirty-eight, to be exact. The date
on the bill proves that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, to-morrow you must go to see him,&#8221;
said Mrs. Hartley, rising. &#8220;But now, my children,
you must go to bed. You can&#8217;t learn any
more to-night, and to-morrow we will pick up
the broken thread. Patty, my dear child, you
are doing a great deal for us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t anything yet,&#8221; said Patty, &#8220;but oh,
if it only leads to something, I shall be so
glad!&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>THE OLD CHIMNEY-PIECE</h3>
</div>

<p>But Sinclair&#8217;s search for the old mason in
Leicester was absolutely unsuccessful.
He learned that Martin Campbell had
died many years ago, and had left no direct
descendants. A cousin of the old mason told
Sinclair all this, and said, too, that there were
no books or papers or accounts of the dead man
left in existence.
</p>
<p>So Sinclair returned home, disappointed but
not entirely discouraged.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll find it yet,&#8221; he said to Patty. &#8220;We
have proof of a hiding-place, now we must discover
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We will!&#8221; declared Patty. &#8220;But it&#8217;s so exasperating
not to know whether the old mason
built that &#8216;pocket&#8217; indoors or out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Out, I think,&#8221; said Sinclair. &#8220;It&#8217;s probably
a sunken bin or vault of brick, made water-tight,
and carefully concealed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s certainly carefully concealed,&#8221; Patty
agreed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span></p>
<p>Sinclair was entitled to a fortnight&#8217;s vacation
from his law studies, and he arranged to take it
at this time. For now that the interest was revived,
all were eager to make search all the
time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s be systematic about it,&#8221; said Bob, &#8220;and
divide the estate up into sections. Then let&#8217;s
examine each section in turn.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This sounded well, but it was weary work. In
the wooded land, especially, it was hopeless to
look for any indicatory mark beneath the undergrowth
of forty years. But each morning the
four young people started out with renewed determination
to keep at it, at any rate.
</p>
<p>On rainy days they searched about the house.
Having found one secret panel, they hoped for
more, and the boys went about tapping the walls
or carved woodwork here and there, listening
for a hollow sound.
</p>
<p>Bob and Patty went on searching the books.
But though a number of old papers were found
they were of no value. Incidentally, Patty was
acquiring a store of information of various sorts.
Though too eager in her work to sit down and
read any book through, she scanned many pages
here and there, and learned much that was interesting
and useful. Especially did she like
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
books that described the old castles and abbeys
of England. There were many of these books,
both architectural and historical, and Patty lingered
over the illustrations, and let her eyes run
hastily over the pages of description.
</p>
<p>One afternoon she sat cross-legged, in Turk
fashion, on the library floor, absorbed in an account
of the beautiful old mansion known as
&#8220;Audley End.&#8221; The description so interested
her that she read on and on, and in her perusal
she came to this sentence:
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are other curious relics, among them
the chair of Alexander Pope, and the carved
oak head of Cromwell&#8217;s bed, converted into a
chimney-piece.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Anything in reference to the headboard of a
bedstead caught Patty&#8217;s attention, and she read
the paragraph over again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sinclair,&#8221; she called, but he had gone elsewhere,
and did not hear her.
</p>
<p>Patty looked around at the mantel or chimney-piece
in the library, but it was so evidently a
part of the plan of wall decoration, that it could
not possibly have been anything else.
</p>
<p>Patty sighed. &#8220;It would have been so lovely,&#8221;
she thought to herself, &#8220;if it only had been a
bedhead, made into a mantel, for then that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
bothering old man could easily have tucked his
money between it and the wall.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And then, though Patty&#8217;s thoughts came slowly,
they came surely, and she remembered that in
the great hall, or living-room, the mantel was a
massive affair of carved oak.
</p>
<p>Half bewildered, Patty dropped the book,
jumped up, and went to the door of the hall.
No one was there, and the girl was glad of it,
for if she really was on the eve of a great discovery
she wanted to be alone at first.
</p>
<p>As she entered the room, the lines came to her
mind:
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;Above the stair, across the hall,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>Between the bedhead and the wall,&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>and she noticed that the chimney-piece stood on
a sort of wide platform, which extended across
that whole end of the hall. Could it be that
Mr. Marmaduke had meant above this platform,
calling it a stair, which ran across the
great hall? For years they had taken the direction
to mean &#8220;up the staircase,&#8221; and &#8220;across
the corridor,&#8221; or hall which led to the bedrooms.
</p>
<p>Slowly, almost as if afraid, Patty crossed the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
hall, stepped up on the platform, and examined
the old chimney-piece. She couldn&#8217;t tell, positively,
but surely, surely it looked as if it <i>might</i>
once have been the headboard of an ancient
bed. It certainly was different in its workmanship
from the wood carving that decorated the
apartment.
</p>
<p>The top of it was well above her head, but
might it not be that the old rhyme meant between
<i>this</i> bedhead and the wall?
</p>
<p>Here they had never looked. It must be that
it was not generally known that this mantel was,
or had been, a bedhead.
</p>
<p>Still, as if in a daze, Patty went and sat in
a chair facing the old chimney-piece, and wondered.
She intended to call the others in a moment,
but first she wanted to enjoy alone the
marvel of her own discovery.
</p>
<p>As she sat there, scrutinising every detail of
the room, the lines kept repeating themselves in
her brain:
</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Above the stair, across the hall,
Between the bedhead and the wall.&#8221;</i>
</p>
<p>If the secret pocket was between that bedhead
and the wall, it was certainly above the stair
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
across the hall! Why had that stair or platform
been built across the hall? It was a peculiar
arrangement.
</p>
<p>This question Patty gave up, but she thought
it might well have been done when the bedhead
was set up there, in order to make the chimney-piece
higher and so more effective.
</p>
<p>Patty had learned something of architecture in
her library browsings.
</p>
<p>Above the high mantel was a large painting.
It was a landscape and showed a beautiful bit
of scenery without buildings or people. In the
foreground were several distinct trees of noble
proportions.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re firs,&#8221; said Patty to herself, for she
had become thoroughly familiar with fir trees.
</p>
<p>And then, like a flash, through her brain came
the words:
</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Great treasure lieth in the poke
Between the fir trees and the oak.&#8221;</i>
</p>
<p>The secret was revealed! Patty knew it!
</p>
<p>Beside the bedhead evidence, it was clear to
her mind that &#8220;Between the fir trees and the
oak,&#8221; meant between these painted fir trees and
the old carved oak mantel. Grasping the arms
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
of her chair, she sat still a minute trying to take
it all in, and then looked about for something
to stand on that she might examine the top of
the old mantel-shelf.
</p>
<p>But her next quick thought was, that that was
not her right. Those to whom the fortune belonged
must make the investigation themselves.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sinclair,&#8221; called Patty, again; &#8220;Mabel, Mrs.
Hartley, where are you all?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bob responded first, and seeing by Patty&#8217;s excited
face that she had discovered something important,
he went in search of the others.
</p>
<p>At last they were all gathered in the great
hall, and Patty&#8217;s sense of the dramatic proved
too strong to allow her to make her announcement
simply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;People,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I have made a discovery.
That is, I think I have. If I am right, the
Cromarty fortune is within your grasp. If I
am wrong&mdash;well, in that case, we&#8217;ll begin all
over again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell us about your new find,&#8221; said Sinclair,
selecting a comfortable chair, and sitting down
as if for a long session. &#8220;Is it another mason&#8217;s
bill?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nobody minded being chaffed about searching
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
or finding, for the subject was treated jocosely
as well as seriously.
</p>
<p>Patty stood on the platform in front of the
carved oak chimney-piece, and addressed her
audience, who listened, half laughing, half
eager.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is this on which I stand?&#8221; she demanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A rug,&#8221; replied Mabel, promptly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean beneath the rug?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The floor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it isn&#8217;t! What is this&mdash;this construction
across the room?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A platform,&#8221; put in Bob, willing to help her
along.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. But what else could it be called? I&#8217;m
in earnest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A step,&#8221; suggested Sinclair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, a step; but couldn&#8217;t it be called a
stair?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It <i>could</i> be,&#8221; said Bob, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t believe
it is one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But suppose your erratic uncle chose to call
it that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; laughed Bob, &#8220;you mean the stair in
the poem.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do. I mean the stair across the hall.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What! Oh, I say, Patty, now you&#8217;re jumbling
up the sense.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not. I&#8217;m straightening out the
sense. Suppose Mr. Marmaduke meant &#8216;above
the stair across the hall,&#8217; and meant this stair
and this hall.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but go on,&#8221; said Sinclair; &#8220;next comes
the bedhead.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my discovery!&#8221; announced Patty,
with what was truly forgivable triumph.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This carved oak chimney-piece is, I have reason
to believe, the headboard of some magnificent,
ancient bed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty Fairfield!&#8221; cried Sinclair, jumping up,
and reaching her side with two bounds.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve struck it! What a girl you are!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a minute,&#8221; said Patty, pushing him
back; &#8220;I&#8217;m entitled to a hearing. Take your
seat again, sir, until I unfold the rest of the
tale.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty was fairly quivering with excitement.
Her cheeks glowed, and her eyes shone, and her
voice trembled as she went on.
</p>
<p>Mabel, with clasped hands, just sat and looked
at her. The elder ladies were plainly bewildered,
and Bob was trying hard to sit still.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I read in an old book,&#8221; Patty went on, &#8220;how
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
somebody else used a carved headboard for a
chimney-piece, and I wondered if this mightn&#8217;t
be one. And it surely looks like it. And then
I wondered if &#8216;above the stair across the hall&#8217;
mightn&#8217;t mean this platform across this hall.
And I think it does. But that&#8217;s not all. My
really important discovery is this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty&#8217;s voice had sunk to a thrilling whisper,
and she addressed herself to Mrs. Cromarty, as
she continued.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the other rhyme, the one that says
the fortune is concealed &#8216;between the fir trees
and the oak,&#8217; refers to this same place, and
means between the painting of fir trees, which
hangs over the mantel, and&mdash;the oak mantel
itself!&#8221;
</p>
<p>With a smiling bow, Patty stepped down from
the platform, and taking a seat by old Mrs.
Cromarty, nestled in that lady&#8217;s loving arms.
The two boys made a spring for the mantel, but
paused simultaneously to grasp both Patty&#8217;s
hands in theirs and nearly shake her arms off.
Then they left the heroine of the hour to Mabel
and Mrs. Hartley and began to investigate the
chimney piece.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Between the fir trees and the oak&#8217;!&#8221; exclaimed
Bob. &#8220;Great, isn&#8217;t it! And here for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
thirty-five years we Cromarty dubs have thought
that meant real trees! To think it took a Yankee
to tell us! Oh, Patty, Patty, we&#8217;ll take down
that historic painting and put up a tablet to the
honour of Saint Patricia. For you surely deserve
canonisation!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Between the bedhead and the wall,&#8217;&#8221;
ruminated Sinclair. &#8220;Well, here goes for finding
an opening.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Clambering up on stools, both boys examined
the place where the mantel shelf touched the
wall. The ornate carvings of the mantel left
many interstices where coins or notes might be
dropped through, yet they were by no means
conspicuous enough to attract the attention of
any one not looking for them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Crickets!&#8221; cried Bob. &#8220;There&#8217;s a jolly
place for the precious poke to be located. I&#8217;m
going down cellar to see if I can find traces of
that mason&#8217;s work. Come on, Clair.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The two boys flew off, and the ladies remained
discussing the wonderful discovery, and examining
the old chimney-piece.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can see it was a bedhead now,&#8221; said Mabel;
&#8220;but I never suspected it before. What a splendid
mantel it makes. Didn&#8217;t you ever hear its
history, Grandy?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, dear. It must have been put there
when the house was built, I think. Though,
of course, it may have been added later. But
it was all before my time. I married your
grandfather Cromarty and came here to live in
1855. The building and decorations then were
all just as they are now, except for such additions
as Marmaduke made. He may have had
that mantel set up in earlier years&mdash;I don&#8217;t
know. He was very fond of antique carvings.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Back came the boys from the cellar.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The whole chimney is bricked up,&#8221; Sinclair
explained. &#8220;We couldn&#8217;t get into it without
tearing it all down. And do you know what I
think, Grandy? I think it would be wiser to
take away the chimney-piece up here, and do
our investigating from this end. Then, if we
find anything, it will all be in this room, and
not in the cellar, where the servants can pry
about.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I quite agree with you,&#8221; said Mrs. Cromarty,
&#8220;and I put the whole matter in your hands.
You and Robert are the sons of the house, and
it is your right to manage its affairs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I say, tear it down at once,&#8221; cried Bob.
&#8220;We needn&#8217;t damage the carving itself, and
all that we break away of plaster or inner woodwork
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
can easily be repaired, whatever our success
may be.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we begin now?&#8221; asked Sinclair, doubtfully.
He was not so impetuous as Bob, and
would have been quite willing to study over the
matter first.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed!&#8221; cried his impatient brother.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to waste a minute. I&#8217;m glad
I&#8217;m a bit of a carpenter. Though not an expert,
I can tear down if I can&#8217;t build up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But we must take it down carefully,&#8221; said
Sinclair. &#8220;These screws must come out first.&#8221;
But Bob had already gone for tools, and soon
returned with screw-drivers, chisels, gimlets, and
all the paraphernalia of a carpenter&#8217;s well-appointed
tool-chest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here goes!&#8221; he cried, as he put the big
screw-driver in the first screw. &#8220;Good luck to
the Cromartys and three cheers for Uncle Marmaduke
and Patty Fairfield!&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>THE DISCOVERY</h3>
</div>

<p>The removal of the old chimney-piece was
not an easy task. If the Hartley boys
hadn&#8217;t been big and strongly-built, they
could scarcely have succeeded in tearing away
the woodwork from the wall. But they did do
it, and their labours were rewarded by the discovery
of the long-lost fortune!
</p>
<p>Sure enough the historic &#8220;poke&#8221; was a pocket
or recess between the old bedhead and the main
wall. It was really built in the chimney itself,
though not in the flue. But this chimney-place,
with its wonderfully carved mantel, was never
used for fires, and the fortune had remained
undisturbed in its hiding-place.
</p>
<p>As the boys lifted away the portion of the
heavy oak that covered the secret pocket, a
rough wall of plaster was seen, and by tapping
on it, Sinclair learned that it was hollow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we break through?&#8221; he said. &#8220;I feel
sure the money is there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Break through, of course,&#8221; cried Bob; &#8220;but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
wait a moment till I lock the doors. This is no
time for intruders.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bob fastened the doors, and then with a
hatchet they broke through the plaster.
</p>
<p>And even as the old mortar crumbled beneath
their blows, out fell a shower of glittering gold
coins and tightly folded banknotes!
</p>
<p>The sight was too much for the strained nerves
of the watchers. Mabel burst into tears, and
Mrs. Cromarty trembled like a leaf.
</p>
<p>The boys broke into shouts of joy, and Patty
scarcely knew whether to laugh or cry. But in
a moment they were all congratulating each
other and showering praises on Patty for her
cleverness in the matter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s ours! It&#8217;s ours!&#8221; cried Bob. &#8220;It&#8217;s
Grandy&#8217;s, to be sure, but it belongs to old Cromarty
Manor, and we&#8217;re all Cromartys. Patty,
you&#8217;re hereby adopted and made one of
us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What shall we do with it?&#8221; asked the more
practical Sinclair. &#8220;I mean, just at present.
We must take care of it, at once, you know.
We can&#8217;t leave it long like this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the old Spanish chest,&#8221; said Mrs.
Hartley, indicating a good-sized affair that
stood nearby. &#8220;Put it in that.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Just the thing,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;Lend a hand,
Clair.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was a strange proceeding. The old coins,
many of them still bright, though of far back
dates; represented a great deal of money. How
much, they could not guess as yet, but it was
surely a large sum. Also there were Bank of
England notes, folded small that they might be
pushed through the openings in the carved oak,
and well-preserved, as the pocket had been carefully
made damp-proof.
</p>
<p>The boys took the money out in double handfuls
and deposited it in the old Spanish chest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be quite safe there until to-morrow,&#8221;
said Mrs. Hartley, &#8220;and then we must get it
to the bank. But as no one yet knows of our
discovery, there can be no danger of its being
stolen to-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What ever made Uncle Marmaduke choose
this way of concealing his fortune?&#8221; asked Bob,
as he kept on transferring the money from its
hiding-place to the chest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He had a fear of banks or investments,&#8221;
said Mrs. Cromarty. &#8220;I&#8217;ve often heard him
say he wouldn&#8217;t trust any of them. He said he&#8217;d
rather be sure of his principal, and go without
his interest.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Crickets!&#8221; said Bob, &#8220;if all this <i>had</i> been
out at interest for forty years, think how it
would have increased!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said his mother, &#8220;but in that case it
would not have been hidden, and before now,
it might have all been spent.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;m glad the old gentleman chose this
way of banking. And I suppose he meant to
leave full instructions where to find it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Sinclair, &#8220;we found it without
his instructions, thanks to our Patty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And then they all began again to bless and
praise Patty, until she was really embarrassed at
their overwhelming gratitude.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d offer you a share,&#8221; said Bob, gaily,
&#8220;but you already have more than you know
what to do with.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps not quite that,&#8221; said Patty, smiling,
&#8220;but I have enough. And, oh! I am so
glad that you have your own at last.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How much do you suppose there is?&#8221; asked
Mabel, awestruck, as she watched the boys
still carrying their precious handfuls across the
room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Enough to buy you some new frocks, sister,&#8221;
said Sinclair, &#8220;and enough to fix up dear old
Cromarty as it should be fixed up.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There must be thousands of pounds,&#8221; said
Grandma Cromarty. &#8220;To think of Marmaduke
exchanging all his securities and bonds for
gold and notes! I suppose he did it while I
was away in London. He was a most erratic
man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you see,&#8221; said Sinclair, thoughtfully,
&#8220;once he had the place built, he could drop his
money through whenever he received any. I can
imagine the old chap, after every one else in
the house was in bed, standing here and dropping
in his coins one by one, and listening to
them clink. Why, it&#8217;s like a child&#8217;s toy savings-bank,
on a large scale.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a large scale!&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;Whew!
I&#8217;m tired out. But it&#8217;s nearly all in the chest
now, and see, Grandy, the chest is nearly full!
When shall we count it? And how <i>shall</i> we
get this mess cleared away? If the servants
come in here, they&#8217;ll know it all, at once.
And I think we ought to keep the matter
quiet until we can cart the gold away to the
bank.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so too,&#8221; said his mother. &#8220;Suppose
we leave this room exactly as it is, and lock it
all up until to-morrow. Then we can talk it
over this evening, and decide what is best to do.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
I think we should consult with Lawyer Ashton,
and let him advise us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So, after carefully securing the windows, and
locking all the doors of the room, it was a
merry-hearted family who went away to dress
for dinner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s put on our prettiest frocks, and make
the dinner a sort of celebration feast,&#8221; said
Patty, who dearly loved an &#8220;occasion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We will,&#8221; said Mabel, &#8220;and Grandy must
wear her black velvet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Cromarty was easily persuaded, and the
happy old lady looked almost regal as, in her
trailing gown, she led the way to the dining-room.
The dinner conversation was on the all-absorbing
topic, and Patty realised afresh how
dearly these people loved their old home, and
how anxious they were to devote their newly-found
fortune to restoring the glories of the
place.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And now we can have the garden party!&#8221;
exclaimed Mabel. &#8220;You know, Patty, we&#8217;ve
had one every summer for years and years, and
this summer we thought we couldn&#8217;t afford it.
What fun to have you here to it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s have it soon,&#8221; said Sinclair. &#8220;Can
you get ready in a week, mother?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Give me a little longer than that, son. And
we want to send out the invitations about ten
days before the party.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll make the lists to-night. Let&#8217;s invite
everybody. I suppose, after we put the money
safely away, there&#8217;s no necessity for secrecy
about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I think not. All our friends will rejoice
with us, that we&#8217;ve found it at last.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Later on, they all sat round the library table,
and made plans for the garden party. Patty discovered
that it would be a much larger and more
important affair than she had imagined. The
invitation list soon rose to about four hundred,
and seemed literally to include everybody in all
the country round.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I really ought to have a new frock for the
party,&#8221; said Mabel; &#8220;but we&#8217;ve so much going
on that I won&#8217;t have time to get one made.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This gave Patty an idea, and she determined
to give Mabel a little surprise. While they
were making the plans for the fête, she was
planning to write to Lady Hamilton and ask
her to send down from London two new frocks
for herself and Mabel to wear at the garden
party. She felt sure she could secretly procure
one of Mabel&#8217;s old dresses to send for a pattern,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
and she meant that Mabel should not know of
it until the new frock arrived.
</p>
<p>The evening was a merry one, indeed. The
boys were so exuberant that they laughed and
sang snatches of songs, and exclaimed over and
over how much they appreciated the good turn
Patty had done them.
</p>
<p>The two elder ladies were more quietly glad,
and it did Patty&#8217;s heart good to see that the
sad, anxious expression was gone from Mabel&#8217;s
face.
</p>
<p>The days before the garden party flew by
quickly, for there was much to be done. Extra
servants had to be secured, some repairing done
in house and gardens, and the caterer&#8217;s orders
attended to. The day before the party the
dresses arrived from London. Lady Hamilton
had chosen them, though Patty had given her a
general idea of what she wanted.
</p>
<p>Though they were called white muslin frocks,
they were made almost entirely of fine embroidery
and lace. Mabel&#8217;s was worn over a
pink silk slip, and Patty&#8217;s over blue. Frenchy
knots of ribbon were placed here and there, and
when the boxes were opened and the tissue
papers torn away, Mabel gave a shriek of delight
at the beautiful things.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span></p>
<p>Patty had wanted to give Mabel a pretty
frock, but had hesitated to do so, lest she wound
her pride.
</p>
<p>But this seemed different, and Patty offered the
gift so prettily, as a souvenir of the garden
party, that Mabel accepted it in the spirit it was
given.
</p>
<p>The day of the party was perfect. Just the
right temperature, and not a cloud in the blue
sky, except some fleecy little white ones that
were as innocent as kittens.
</p>
<p>The party was from three till six, and
promptly at three o&#8217;clock the guests began to
arrive. There was a continuous stream of carriages
and motor cars, and soon Patty was almost
bewildered by the crowds of people. Although
introduced to them as they arrived, she
couldn&#8217;t remember them all. But many of them
she had met before, and after a time she and
Mabel were excused from the receiving party,
and were sent to mingle with the guests.
</p>
<p>The old place was looking its best. Though
there had not been time for much work on the
gardens, yet a deal of tidying up had been
done. New flowers had been set out in the
formal flower beds, the fountains had been repaired
and put in working order, and the shrubs
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
and hedges had been trimmed. Patty, looking
very sweet in her lovely white dress, wandered
around indoors and out, greeting old friends and
making new ones.
</p>
<p>The house was thrown open, and of course the
old chimney-piece, which had been replaced,
was scrutinised with great interest. Patty was
lionised until she became almost embarrassed
at being made so prominent. But everybody
was thoroughly glad that the Cromartys had
come into their fortune at last. On the lawn
was a band of musicians in gay scarlet and gold
uniforms, who played popular music at intervals
during the afternoon. The terraces and
gardens were filled with groups of people pleasantly
chatting, and the ladies&#8217; pretty summer
costumes added to the brilliancy of the
scene.
</p>
<p>At four o&#8217;clock tea was served in a great round
tent, which had been put up for the purpose.
Although called tea, the repast was a substantial
supper of various and elaborate viands. Patty
thought she had never seen so many sorts of
salads and carefully constructed cold dishes.
She sat at a small table with the Merediths and
some other young people.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going to stay here all summer, aren&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
you?&#8221; asked Tom, who sincerely hoped she
was.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; replied Patty. &#8220;I&#8217;d love to
stay, for I&#8217;m happy every minute here. But my
own people are writing me very urgently to
join them in Switzerland. They&#8217;re in such delightful
quarters there, that they think I&#8217;d like
it too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t go. Stay here with us. We&#8217;re
going to get up a croquet club, and we want you
to be a member.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be glad to, if I stay. But where are the
people going now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The guests had all risen, and were being led
to a part of the grounds where a platform had
been erected. On this were a troupe of entertainers
called The Pierrots. They all wore
funny white suits, with little black pompons bobbing
all over them. They sang amusing songs,
played on cymbals and other instruments, did
some clever acrobatic work, and for a half-hour
entertained the guests who stood about on the
grass, or sat on camp chairs to watch them.
</p>
<p>At six o&#8217;clock the guests all took leave, and the
great procession of vehicles again appeared on
the driveway. Mrs. Cromarty and Mrs. Hartley
received their good-byes, and Patty and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
Mabel invited a number of the young people to
remain to dine and spend the evening.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Though I&#8217;m sure we can&#8217;t eat any dinner,
after that very satisfying tea,&#8221; said Grace Meredith,
as she accepted the invitation.
</p>
<p>In the evening they all went out on the lake
for a moonlight row. Several new boats had
been bought, and the young men rowed the
girls about. The boats were hung with Chinese
lanterns, which gave the lake the appearance of
a regatta or a water festival.
</p>
<p>Then back to the house for a dance in the
great hall. The musicians had remained, and to
their inspiriting strains the young people glided
about in merry measures.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do give me another waltz,&#8221; Tom Meredith
begged of Patty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be glad to, Tom,&#8221; said Patty, frankly;
&#8220;but I can&#8217;t do it without offending somebody
else. I love to dance with you, but you&#8217;ve had
three already, and I&#8217;ve promised all the rest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Tom wheedled Mrs. Hartley into allowing
one more extra, after the last dance, and he
claimed Patty for that.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the best dancer I ever saw,&#8221; said
Tom, as they floated away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the best English dancer I ever saw,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
laughed Patty, for she well knew English people
do not dance like Americans. Good-natured
Tom didn&#8217;t mind her implication, and after the
waltz was ended he led her out on the terrace
to sit down for a bit and rest. There were
several others there, the Hartley boys among
them, and soon they began to sing songs.
</p>
<p>Others came and joined them, and the young
voices rose in merry choruses and glees.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have splendid songs in England,&#8221; said
Patty, after the men&#8217;s voices had come out
strong in &#8220;Hearts of Oak&#8221; and &#8220;Rule Britannia.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we have,&#8221; agreed Tom. &#8220;But, Patty,
won&#8217;t you sing something alone?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do,&#8221; chorused the rest, and Mabel said:
&#8220;Sing that newest song that you and Sinclair
made.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;The Moon&#8217;s Song?&#8217;&#8221; asked Patty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; this is just the night for it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The moon was nearing the western horizon,
and its soft light fell across the lake in silver
ripples. Truly it was just the time and place
to sing the pretty song of which Patty had composed
the words, and Sinclair had set them to
music. It was a simple air, but full of soft,
lingering cadences, and without accompaniment
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
Patty&#8217;s really sweet voice sounded exquisite as it
thrilled through the summer evening air.
</p>
<p>The song was called &#8220;The Minstrel Moon,&#8221;
and the words were these:
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;I wonder if the moon could sing,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>On a marvellous, mystical night in spring,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>I wonder what the song would be</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>That the minstrel moon would sing to me.</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>And as I think, I seem to know</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>How the music of the moon would go.</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>It would be a mystic, murmuring strain</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>Like the falling of far-away fairy rain.</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>Just a soft and silvery song</p>

<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 8em;'>Of a tune</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>GOOD-BYES</h3>
</div>

<p>One beautiful morning, about a week
after the garden party, Patty lay in her
favourite hammock out under the trees.
She liked this hammock especially, for from it
she could see both terraces, the formal gardens,
and the lake beyond.
</p>
<p>As she looked around this morning she could
see the workmen busily engaged in restoring
the gardens to their original symmetry and
beauty. The Hartleys were by no means purse
proud or ostentatious, and their sudden acquisition
of a great fortune in no way changed their
simple, pleasant attitude toward life. But they
were now enabled to live in their dear old home,
without financial anxieties, and moreover, were
able to repair and restore its appointments.
</p>
<p>But though Patty loved to let her idle gaze
roam over the attractive landscape, her thoughts
just now were far away. She had in her hand
a letter from her father, and its message was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
strongly in favour of her leaving Cromarty
Manor and joining her parents in Switzerland.
</p>
<p>It was for Patty to make choice, but both Nan
and Mr. Fairfield urged the plan they proposed.
So Patty was thinking it over. She was very
happy at Cromarty, and the life was quiet and
pleasant, and interspersed with many little
gaieties. But she thought, herself, it was a pity
not to travel about and see sights and places
when opportunity presented itself.
</p>
<p>As she lay, thinking, she saw a large motorcar
coming along the drive through the park.
She jumped out of the hammock and started toward
the house, in order to greet the guests whoever
they might be. As the car came nearer,
she saw a lady and gentleman in the tonneau,
but so concealed were they by their motor-clothes
she could not recognise them.
</p>
<p>As they drew nearer, the lady waved her hand,
and seeing the familiar gesture, Patty at once
realised that it was Lady Hamilton.
</p>
<p>Her father was with her, and Patty ran to
meet them, and reached the steps of the great
entrance of Cromarty just as the car swung
round the last curve of the road.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Kitty!&#8221; cried Patty; &#8220;I&#8217;m <i>so</i> glad to
see you! Where did you come from? Why
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
didn&#8217;t you tell me you were coming? How do
you do, Sir Otho. This is indeed a surprise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How are you, my dear child?&#8221; said Sir
Otho Markleham, after Patty had released
Lady Kitty from her enthusiastic embrace, and
turned to shake hands with her father.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in,&#8221; said Patty, dancing about in her
excited glee. &#8220;Come right in. You are welcome
to Cromarty Manor, and in a moment the
family will also tell you so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What a delightful house!&#8221; said Lady
Hamilton, pausing to admire the stately old
portal.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, isn&#8217;t it? You know the Hartleys, don&#8217;t
you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Slightly. I&#8217;ll be glad to see them again.
But, of course, we came to see you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s a lovely surprise. Are you staying
near here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only for a day or two,&#8221; said Sir Otho.
&#8220;We&#8217;re taking a little jaunt about, and as Kitty
wanted to see you especially, we came in this
direction.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The chauffeur and the big touring car were put
in charge of the Cromarty coachman, and Patty
ushered her guests into the house.
</p>
<p>The ladies soon appeared and with hospitable
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
welcome insisted that Sir Otho and his daughter
should remain for a few days. This they were
unable to do, but it was finally decided that they
should stay the night, and resume their trip the
next day.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; said Sir Otho, &#8220;it may seem a rather
sudden proceeding, but we want to take Patty
with us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Take Patty!&#8221; exclaimed Mabel, aghast;
&#8220;for how long?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You tell her,&#8221; said Sir Otho, smiling at his
daughter. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t the courage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll explain later,&#8221; said Lady Hamilton.
&#8220;But now, I want to enjoy the beauties of this
grand old place. Is this the celebrated apartment
where the fortune was hidden?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Patty, who had written to Lady
Kitty about the matter. &#8220;And here is the old
chimney-piece.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can imagine, Lady Hamilton,&#8221; said
Mrs. Hartley, &#8220;the deep debt of gratitude we
are under to our dear Patty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must be, indeed. But I know Patty
is quite as glad that she made the discovery as
you are yourselves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The rest of the morning was devoted to showing
the visitors about the place. Sir Otho was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
greatly interested in the plans for the restoration
of the gardens, and both he and Lady
Kitty were enraptured with the historic treasures
of the old house. After luncheon, Lady
Hamilton unfolded her plans to Patty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been in correspondence with Mr. and
Mrs. Fairfield,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and we&#8217;ve concluded
that we must have Patty back with us again.
She has been very happy here, I know, but she
has made you a long visit, and I&#8217;ve really been
sent down here to kidnap her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty smiled, but the others didn&#8217;t. Mrs. Cromarty
and Mrs. Hartley looked truly sorry, and
Mabel had to struggle to keep her tears
back.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; said Mrs. Cromarty, at last.
&#8220;We have enjoyed having Patty here more than
I can tell you. But we must not be selfish. I
know her parents have been writing for her
to go to them, and it is wrong for us to urge
her to stay here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t want Patty to go away,&#8221; said
Mabel, and now she was really crying.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you don&#8217;t, dearie,&#8221; said her mother.
&#8220;But I see it as Grandma does, and I think we
must let her go. Perhaps some time she&#8217;ll come
again.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I hope so,&#8221; said Patty, smiling through
the tears that had gathered in her own eyes.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve all been so good to me, and I&#8217;ve had
such lovely times.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The question once settled, Lady Hamilton
went on to say that she proposed to take
Patty away the next day. Of course this
redoubled Mabel&#8217;s woe, but Lady Kitty was
firm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be just as hard to spare her a week
hence,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And then, who would take
her to London? If she goes with us to-morrow,
we will keep her with us for the rest of our
motor tour&mdash;about a week&mdash;and then reach
London about the first of July. After that
Patty and I will join Mr. and Mrs. Fairfield
in Switzerland, and go on to do some further
travelling.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Although Patty was sorry to leave Cromarty,
this plan did sound delightful, and she was glad
that it was all settled for her, and she had no
further responsibility in the matter.
</p>
<p>Lady Hamilton had a genius for despatch, and
she superintended the packing of Patty&#8217;s clothes
and belongings that same afternoon. Except
for the luggage needed on the motor-tour, everything
was to be sent to Lady Kitty&#8217;s home in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
London, and Patty had to smile, as she realised
that her present temporary home was the great
house where she had so daringly braved the
irascible Sir Otho.
</p>
<p>There was a daintily furnished room in the
Markleham house that had been set aside for
Patty&#8217;s very own, and whenever she cared to
she was invited to occupy it.
</p>
<p>When the boys came home that afternoon and
heard the news, they set up a wail of woe that
was both genuine and very noisy.
</p>
<p>No one could help admiring Lady Kitty, but
Sinclair and Bob felt as if she were robbing their
household, and it required all their good manners
to hide their feeling of resentment.
</p>
<p>But they rose nobly to the occasion, and Bob
said: &#8220;Well, since Patty must go, we&#8217;ll have
to send her off in a blaze of glory. Let&#8217;s make
a party, mother, a few people to dinner, and
some more for the evening.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hartley quickly realised that this would
be the best way to tide over a sad occasion, and
she agreed. The Merediths and a few others
were sent for to come to dinner, and a dozen
or more young people asked for a little dance
in the evening. Notwithstanding her unwelcome
errand, Lady Kitty fitted right into the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
house party, and both she and her father were so
affable and pleasant that the Hartleys forgave
them for stealing Patty away.
</p>
<p>The tourists had luggage with them, so were
able to don attire suitable to the party. Lady
Hamilton wore one of her beautiful trailing lace
gowns, which had won for her Patty&#8217;s name of
&#8220;The White Lady.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty, too, wore a white frock, of ruffled organdie,
with touches of pale green velvet. In
her pretty hair was a single pink rose, and as she
arranged it, she felt a pang as she thought
that might be the last flower she would ever
wear from the dear old Cromarty rose garden.
The dinner was a beautiful feast, indeed. The
table sparkled with the old silver and glass that
had belonged to the Cromarty ancestors. Flowers
were everywhere, and the table and dining-room
were lighted entirely by wax candles, with
the intent of abiding by the old traditions of the
manor.
</p>
<p>At Patty&#8217;s plate was a multitude of gifts.
How they managed it on such short notice,
she never knew, but every one of the family
and most of the guests gave her a parting
souvenir.
</p>
<p>Grandma Cromarty gave her a valuable old
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
miniature that had long been in her historic collection.
Mrs. Hartley gave her an exquisite
fan, painted by a celebrated artist. Mabel gave
her a ring set with a beautiful pearl, and the
boys together gave her a splendid set of
Dickens&#8217; works in elaborately gilded binding.
Grace Meredith brought her a bangle, and
Tom a quaint old-fashioned candlestick; and
many other guests brought pretty or curious
trifles.
</p>
<p>Patty was overwhelmed at this unexpected
kindness, and opened parcel after parcel in a
bewilderment of delight.
</p>
<p>Everybody was gay and merry, yet there was
an undercurrent of sadness, as one after another
remembered this was the last time they would
see pretty Patty.
</p>
<p>After dinner they all assembled on the terrace,
and the other guests, arriving later, joined them
there.
</p>
<p>But the soft beauty of the summer evening
seemed to intensify the spirit of sadness, and
all were glad to hear the strains of a violin
coming from the great hall.
</p>
<p>Bob had sent for two or three musicians, and
soon the young people were spinning around in
the dance, and merriment once more reigned.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span></p>
<p>Always a popular partner, Patty was fairly
besieged that night.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t,&#8221; she said laughingly, as the young
men gathered around to beg her favours; &#8220;I&#8217;ve
halved every dance already; I can&#8217;t do more
than that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t halve this one,&#8221; said Tom Meredith,
as he led her away for a waltz. &#8220;I must have
all of it. Unless you&#8217;ll sit it out with me on
the terrace.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thank you,&#8221; said Patty. &#8220;I&#8217;d rather
dance. I don&#8217;t suppose I&#8217;ll find another dancer
as good as you all summer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate to think of your going away,&#8221; said
Tom. &#8220;You almost promised me you&#8217;d stay
here all summer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know. But I&#8217;m not mistress of my own
plans. They&#8217;re made for me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re glad of it,&#8221; said Tom, almost
angrily. &#8220;You&#8217;re glad you&#8217;re going away from
here&mdash;to go motoring in Switzerland, and all
sorts of things.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be so savage. It isn&#8217;t surprising that
I&#8217;m glad to go away from any one as cross as
you are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom had to smile in return for Patty&#8217;s laughing
tones, and he said more gently:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean to be bearish, but I wish you
weren&#8217;t going. I&mdash;I like you an awful lot,
Patty. Truly I do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad of it,&#8221; said Patty, heartily, &#8220;and I
like you too. After Sinclair and Bob, you&#8217;re the
nicest boy in England.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s luck in odd numbers,&#8221; said Tom, a
little ruefully, &#8220;so I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m number three.
But I&#8217;d like to be number one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re a number one dancer,&#8221; said
Patty, as the music ceased, and with that Tom
had to be content.
</p>
<p>And now the hour was getting late and the
young people began to go home.
</p>
<p>It was really an ordeal for Patty to say good-bye,
for she had many friends among them, and
they all seemed truly regretful to part with
her.
</p>
<p>But after they had gone, and only those staying
in the house remained, another surprise was
in waiting for Patty. They were gathered in
the great hall, talking over for the last time the
mystery of the hidden fortune, and Patty&#8217;s
clever solution of it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; said Sinclair, &#8220;I&#8217;ve a little
speech to make.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He went and stood on the &#8220;stair across the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
hall,&#8221; in front of the old chimney-piece, and so,
just beneath the picture of the fir trees. The
painting was a fine one, and represented a landscape
with firs in the foreground. It had hung
there since the days of the earlier Cromartys,
and was a valuable work of art.
</p>
<p>Patty had always loved the picture, even before
the added interest of learning the truth
about the fir trees, and they all knew it was one
of her favourites among the many art treasures
of the old house.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was going to make this speech when the
party was here,&#8221; proceeded Sinclair, &#8220;but I
didn&#8217;t, partly because I feared it might embarrass
Patty, and partly because I like it better
to have only our own people here. But the
speech itself is this: We, the Cromartys of Cromarty
Manor, realising that we can never liquidate
the great debt of gratitude we owe to our
beautiful and beloved friend, Miss Patty Fairfield,
wish, at least, to give her a token of
our affection and a memento of her noble
deed. We, therefore, one and all of the household
of Cromarty, offer her this picture of
fir trees, this painting by Hobbema, and we
trust that she will accept it in the spirit it is
tendered.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span></p>
<p>Sinclair bowed and sat down, and Patty sat
for a moment in awestruck silence.
</p>
<p>Then, &#8220;The Hobbema!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;I
won&#8217;t take it! The idea of giving me that
painting! Why, it&#8217;s one of the gems of the
house!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why we want you to have it, Patty
dear,&#8221; said Grandma Cromarty, gently. &#8220;It is
one of our treasures, and for that very reason it
is worthy to be presented as a souvenir to one
who so gloriously deserves it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hear! Hear!&#8221; cried Bob. &#8220;Grandy
makes a better speech than you, Clair.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty&#8217;s scruples were lovingly overcome, and
she was made to realise that she was the owner
of a real masterpiece of art, that would be to
her a lifelong delight.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what will take its place?&#8221; she said.
&#8220;It has hung there so many years.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It hung there,&#8221; said Mrs. Hartley, &#8220;until its
mission was fulfilled. Now that there is nothing
to be searched for &#8216;between the fir trees and
the oak,&#8217; it need hang there no longer. It is
fitting that we retain the &#8216;oak&#8217; and you possess
the &#8216;fir trees,&#8217; thus assuring an everlasting bond
of union between the fir trees and the
oak.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Bravo, Mater!&#8221; cried Bob. &#8220;You&#8217;re coming
out strong on speechifying, too. Mabel, we
must look out for our laurels.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Mabel was too near the verge of tears to
trust her voice, so she slipped her hand in
Patty&#8217;s, knowing that she would understand all
that could not be said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; went on Bob, &#8220;I&#8217;m not much of an
orator, but I&#8217;ll take it for my part to see that
the Fir Trees are properly packed and sent to
your home, Patty. Where shall I send the
box?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate to have it go to New York now,&#8221; said
Patty, &#8220;for I want it with me while I&#8217;m over
here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So it was arranged to send the picture to Sir
Otho&#8217;s house in London, there to remain until
the Fairfields returned to America.
</p>
<p>The departure from Cromarty was made next
morning directly after breakfast. It was fortunate
that the last details of luggage preparations,
and the packing of luncheon and so forth,
made a bustle and hurry that left little time
for actual farewells. And, too, they were all too
sensible to mar Patty&#8217;s last memory of Cromarty
with futile regrets.
</p>
<p>So after good-byes were said, and the party
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
stowed away in the big car, Sinclair started
one of their favourite nonsense songs.
</p>
<p>The others joined in, and Patty sang too, and
handkerchiefs were waved, and as the car slid
out of sight among the trees, those who were
left could still hear Patty&#8217;s high, sweet soprano
ringing back to them.
